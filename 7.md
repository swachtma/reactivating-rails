# Chapter 7: Managing API Connections with Sagas

It's time we got serious about how we manage our requests to our API.  So far, we've stuck them in somewhat haphazardly as we've run into requirements for data in our application.  We saw first-hand in Chapter 6 how that can become problematic when a requirement for data ran its course before our API request had a chance to complete.

In general, managing API requests as part of your render cycle is frowned upon in React.  It almost always leads to React running extra render cycles that would not otherwise be required.

Instead, we want to transition our API request to happen as a side effect of actions dispatched to our Redux store.  To do this we'll be introducing Redux Saga into our application.

## Jumping in Here

If you haven't been following along with code examples and want to jump in here, you can use our [Chapter7Starter](https://github.com/swachtma/reactivating-rails-app/tree/Chapter7Starter) branch as a place to join in.

## What About Thunk?

If you've used React/Redux for any amount of time, you've probably heard of a very popular Middleware redux-thunk (or simply Thunk).

Thunk is a middleware for Redux that adds an ability for you to dispatch actions which return functions, instead of the traditional plain JavaScript objects.  Take a look at this simplified example Thunk, and I think you'll get the idea pretty quickly.

``` javascript
  const loadChapterUnlessComplete = () => {
    return (dispatch,getState) => {
      if(getState().chapters === []){
        // Manage API call
        dispatch(actions.loadChapters(payload));
      }
    }
  }
```

Instead of being simple object factories, our action creators will return functions which can optionally receive the `dispatch` and `getState` functions from our store.  This allows our return functions to perform evaluation of the current state of the store, and dispatch additional actions as needed.  In the simplified example above, we see a check of the state of our `chapters` state tree in the store.  If we find the store has already loaded chapters, we short-circuit the API call, otherwise, we fire the API and dispatch another action once we have the data.

It's a very popular, and very powerful middleware.  So why am I not using it?  Personal preferences for a different tool.

There are a few things I don't like about Thunk, but most of them are trivial.  The first, is that the change from dispatching simple objects, to me obscures the beautiful simplicity of Redux itself.  I like being able to know that when I am looking at a store dispatch, I am looking at a simple JavaScript object. 

And an extension to this is testing.  I find testing Thunk to be more of a headache to test than Redux Saga which we'll be looking at.  With Thunk I find myself spending more time trying to figure out how to mock my tests than I do writing code. 

That said, Thunk is a very common middleware, so being at least passingly familiar with it would do you good if you want to explore it outside of this project.  It's also worth noting that our router, Redux First Router supports thunks.  So much so in fact, that without even installing the Thunk middleware, you can setup your routeMap to dispatch a Thunk in response to a routing action.  So it's a very easy tool to integrate with the stack we're already using.

## Redux Saga

We'll be using Redux Saga instead of Thunk to manage our API connections, as well as any number of other complicated state transformations.  

If you’ve been introduced to Sagas before, you might want to do a little studying about what a Saga is, before we even dive into learning about Redux-Saga, (the specific package we'll be using).  There's a video suggested on Redux-Saga's documentation site about sagas as a design pattern, which gives an [excellent introduction to using Sagas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDuwrtwYHu8) to simplify asynchronous programming.  So watch it as some optional homework if you'd like some background.

### ES2015 Generator Functions

Before we can dive into Sagas, we need to spend a little time talking about generator functions, a new piece of ES2015 syntax.

At their simplest, I would describe generator functions as special functions that can stop and resume their execution; surrendering control to other areas of our applications, and regaining control when the generator has the information needed to advance.  Generator functions are declared using the special `function*` keyword, and just like functions, can accept a list of parameters.  However, we typically think of functions running from beginning to end without interruption.  A function gets invoked, and it either runs until it returns a value (which maybe be undefined), or something causes us to break, and terminate execution.

A generator however, has access to a special keyword `yield`, which will pass control of execution off to another thread of our application.  The next time the generator is invoked, execution will resume where it left off and carry on until the next yield of the generator, or completion.  The context of generator functions (their scope inside the function's `{}` pair) is preserved over their entire lifecycle.

When a generator is first called, it doesn't begin execution.  Instead, it return a special function known as an iterator, which provides us with a `.next()` method.  The iterator is used to manage the execution of our generator as control is resumed and surrendered over the generator’s lifecycle.  Let's look at some examples.

``` javascript
function* countForever(){
  let count = 1;
  while(true){
    console.log(count);
    count += 1;
    yield
  }
}

let counter = countForever();
// No console log here, instead we receive our iterator function.

counter.next()
//Console: 1
counter.next()
//Console: 2
counter.next()
//Console: 3
```

Several things of note here.  First, appreciate our infinite while loop.  Normally we'd avoid creating an infinite loop in our functions as they would permanently trap execution.  But this highlights an important feature of generators; since each yield statement suspends execution until the next time `iterator.next()` is called, we don't lock our application.  Instead this infinite loop ensure our generator never reaches it's finished state, and will happily keep counting for as long as we need.

We haven't mentioned that each time your generator reaches a yield it will also return a value.  In our previous example these would have looked like the following: `{value: undefined, done: false}`.  Value can be used to pass back a value from inside the generator.  The `done` attribute exists to alert us when the generator has reached the end of its execution lifecycle (no remaining yields).

In this case, our generator’s infinite loop ensures we never reach the done state of this generator.  And since the state of the generator is preserved until it’s completion, it will always stay there, waiting to yield us the next number in the sequence each time we invoke `next()` on the iterator.
We can also use the iterators `next` method to pass values back into the generator.  Let's take a look.

``` javascript
function* countWithMeForever(next){
  let count = 1;
  console.log("Let's count together!")
  
  while(true){
    let next = yield
    if(next === count){
      console.log(count + "!");
    } else {
      console.log("I think you meant " + count = "...");
    }
    count += 1;
  }
}

let counter = countForever();
// No console log here, instead we receive our iterator function.

counter.next()
//Console: Let's count together!
counter.next(1)
//Console: 1!
counter.next(2)
//Console: 2!
counter.next(2)
//Console: I think you meant 3...
```

Now, our counter will cheerily count along with you each time our iterator’s `next` method is called.  The value passed through next can be assigned through our yield statements inside our generator.  This allows our counter to happily parrot back the numbers we pipe in, or admonish us if we happen to lose count along the way.

The code we've worked with here has been synchronous, and that makes our examples a bit contrived.  The power of generators really shines when we begin working with asynchronous actions.  Our generators can dispatch work to an asynchronous function and then yield control of execution to other threads while waiting for a response.  Then pick right back up where they left off once data is available to continue.

Redux Saga makes heavy use of generators to do just that.  And to make things even better, the Redux Saga middleware will by-in-large manage our iterators for us by giving us a library of helper methods called effects to help orchestrate asynchronous operations.

### Installing Redux Saga

Before we go any further into the details let's get the installation of Redux saga behind us.  Start with the package install `npm install --save redux-saga`.

Then we'll need to make modifications to our store to include Redux Saga's middleware (`src/reducers/store.js`).

``` javascript
import { createStore, combineReducers, applyMiddleware } from "redux";
import { composeWithDevTools } from 'redux-devtools-extension';
import createSagaMiddleware from 'redux-saga'
import { connectRoutes } from 'redux-first-router';
import restoreScroll from 'redux-first-router-restore-scroll'
import createHistory from 'history/createBrowserHistory';

import * as ROUTES from '../constants/settings';
import chapters from './chapters';
import nodes from './nodes';
import settings from './settings';

const history = createHistory();
const routeMap = {
  // Routes here "ACTION_NAME":"/some/route"
  [ROUTES.HOME_ROUTE]: "/",
  [ROUTES.CHAPTER_ROUTE]: "/chapter/:chapter_id"
};

const { reducer: routeReducer, middleware: routerMiddleware, enhancer: routerEnhancer } = connectRoutes(
  history,
  routeMap,
  { restoreScroll: restoreScroll() }
);

const reducers = combineReducers({location: routeReducer, settings, nodes, chapters});

const sagaMiddleware = createSagaMiddleware();
const middlewares = applyMiddleware(routerMiddleware, sagaMiddleware);

const store = createStore(
  reducers, composeWithDevTools(routerEnhancer, middlewares)
);

export default store;
```

No major changes here.  We're now including the `createSagaMiddleware` factory to generate the middleware Redux Sage will need.  Then that returned middleware is being included in our `applyMiddleware()` chain to tie it to our store.

We're now ready to write our first saga.

## Saga Watchers and Workers

Redux Saga is designed to watch your dispatched store actions and intercede with more complicated operations when it sees certain watched action types dispatched to the store.  Because of this pattern, you will often hear Sagas described in the terms of watcher and workers.

We'll start by writing our first watcher saga.  As suggested by the name, a watcher will watch our store, and wait for actions with a specific `type` attribute to be dispatched.  When the dispatch is observed, they will then invoke a worker which handle the needed operations.  My goal for this first iteration with Sagas is to finally remove our API calls from the lifecycle methods of our components, and to setup a new mechanism to instantiate our store with chapter and node information.

We have a perfect infrastructure to do this already in place, given to us by our routing.  It seems to me that we should tie the requests for chapters/nodes to our routes that require this information.  That way, in the future, if we add additional static pages that don't require the book contents, we can delay loading until we're sure we need the content.  This will save our API from processing unneeded requests.  And since our routing already dispatches actions to represent route changes, it’s all just begging to be unified.

## Our First Saga

We're going to be using Sagas as another major layer of our client infrastructure, so I prefer to store them in their own application folder.  Create a new file/folder at `src/sagas/routes.js`.

``` javascript
import { takeEvery } from 'redux-saga/effects';

import routes from '../constants/routes';

export function* watchBookRoutesSaga(){
  yield takeEvery([routes.HOME_ROUTE, routes.CHAPTER_ROUTE], instantiateBook);
};
```

To start, we've set up a watcher for our application’s home and chapter routes.  We're using the same constants file we've used in other areas of the application to plug into the `type` values that will be dispatched when these routes are requested.

The watcher itself is a generator function, and we're using an effect provided by Redux Saga to manage our watch of the chapter and home route paths.  

When we ran through our crash course on generators, we were managing both sides of the generator functions; we were directly managing the iterator functions and the invocations of the `next()` method.  Our work with Redux saga will be considerably easier because the Redux Saga Middleware will manage the iterators of our generator functions.  In turn, the generators we define will use helpers provided by Redux Saga to yield plain JavaScript objects.  These objects will give different instructions to the middleware on how to manage our iterators, and by extension manage our asynchronous actions.

In this case, `takeEvery` will fire our paired generator (in this case `instantiateBook`) every time the `HOME_ROUTE` or `CHAPTER_ROUTE` action are dispatched.  

As an alternative example, we could use the `takeLatest` effect, which would also begin the `instantiateBook` saga each time a matching route was dispatched.   However, `takeLatest` has the additional effect of cancelling any previous instances of `instantiateBook` that might have been underway already when the latest matching dispatch was observed.

I also want to be clear that we could tie a watcher saga to **any** action type that might be dispatched to our store.  That includes actions that might not do anything at all, except trigger a saga.

This might take some time to wrap your head around.  For now, just know that Redux Saga will simplify the more complex operations of managing our generators, giving us a simplified set of side effects that let us plan our sagas according to how we want our asynchronous actions managed.  
Our generators dispatch simple objects to dictate instructions about how these operations should be handled.  A simplicity which we'll really come to appreciate when we start to test our sagas.

Let's look at a worker now.

``` javascript
import { takeEvery, put, call } from 'redux-saga/effects';
import axios from 'axios';

import * as routes from '../constants/settings';
import { loadNodes } from '../actions/nodes';

export function* instantiateBook(){
  try{
    const response = yield call(axios.get,'/api/nodes');
    yield put(loadNodes(response.data));
    
  }
  catch(e){
    console.log(e);
  }
} 

export function* watchBookRoutesSaga(){
  yield takeEvery([routes.HOME_ROUTE, routes.CHAPTER_ROUTE], instantiateBook);
};
```

We are introducing several more side effects now from redux-saga.  First, our generator will wrap it's work in a try/catch block.  This will allow us an easy way to split off our error handling in the future when we're ready to add more complex handling.  For now, focus on the try branch.

Out first yield is using a side effect `call`, which will cause a function passed to be invoked by our saga middleware, and when that function is resolved, the resulting value of the call will be returned to our yield statement.  Call accepts the function we wish to invoke as its first parameter, and then a list of parameters we wish to pass to that function.  So the result of this `call` side effect will be the invocation of `axios.get("/api/nodes")`, and the resulting response will be assigned to our const `response`.

From there, we come to another yield, which is using the `put` side effect.  The `put` side effect is used to dispatch actions to our store.  So in this case, once we have the response back from our API, we will dispatch the resulting data to our loadNodes action.

Before we finish wiring this in, let's do one more housekeeping step.  Create a new file, `src/sagas/root.js`, and fill in the following code.

``` javascript
import { all } from 'redux-saga/effects';
import { watchBookRoutesSaga } from './routes';

export default function* rootSaga(){
  yield all([
    watchBookRoutesSaga()
  ]);
}
```

As we add more sagas, each will need to be passed to our saga middleware to connect them to our store.  Our root saga will serve as the entry point for all of our watchers, running in parallel using the `all` effect.  We'll be talking about this more as need arises, but for now it's worth noting that our sagas, can themselves invoke other sagas like this to manage several complex interactions at once.  This rootSaga, is simply giving us a single point of entry which allows us to bind all other sagas to the store.  But you might write a saga, which itself uses several smaller sagas to manage units of work.

Finally, we need to make a few more modifications to the store in `src/reducers/store.js`.

``` javascript
import { createStore, combineReducers, applyMiddleware } from "redux";
import { composeWithDevTools } from 'redux-devtools-extension';
import createSagaMiddleware from 'redux-saga'
import { connectRoutes } from 'redux-first-router';
import restoreScroll from 'redux-first-router-restore-scroll'
import createHistory from 'history/createBrowserHistory';

import * as ROUTES from '../constants/settings';
import chapters from './chapters';
import nodes from './nodes';
import settings from './settings';
import rootSaga from '../sagas/root';

const history = createHistory();
const routeMap = {
  // Routes here "ACTION_NAME":"/some/route"
  [ROUTES.HOME_ROUTE]: "/",
  [ROUTES.CHAPTER_ROUTE]: "/chapter/:chapter_id"
};

const { reducer: routeReducer, middleware: routerMiddleware, enhancer: routerEnhancer, initialDispatch } = connectRoutes(
  history,
  routeMap,
  { restoreScroll: restoreScroll(), initialDispatch: false }
);

const reducers = combineReducers({location: routeReducer, settings, nodes, chapters});

const sagaMiddleware = createSagaMiddleware();

const middlewares = applyMiddleware(sagaMiddleware, routerMiddleware);

const store = createStore(
  reducers, composeWithDevTools(routerEnhancer, middlewares)
);

sagaMiddleware.run(rootSaga);
initialDispatch();

export default store;
```

First, we need to modify our router setup where we invoke `connectRoutes`.  We're now assigning a new return value `initialDispatch`, and also passing a new option `initialDispatch: false` in our options block.

Normally, Redux First Router will fire the initial route's dispatch immediately when it is connected to our store.  This causes us a timing problem though with redux-saga.  Note the new line `sagaMiddleware.run(rootSaga);` which starts our sagas.  This cannot be invoked until after store creation.  So if we allow redux-first-router` to manage its own initial dispatch, our sagas won't be setup to listen for the dispatched action in time.  

So instead, we are now manually firing the `initialDispatch` after running our sagas.

Now, let's update our `App.js` component to cease managing its own API call.

``` javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import './App.css'

import ReaderPane from './components/reader_pane';
import MenuBar from './components/menu_bar';
import FilteredNodesList from './containers/filtered_nodes_list';

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div id="app">
        <MenuBar />
        <ReaderPane>
          <FilteredNodesList />
        </ReaderPane>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

Doesn't that look much nicer?  We can say goodbye to our `componentWillMount` API call.  Since we no longer need the component to dispatch our `loadNodes` action, we can also cut `mapDispatchToProps`, and disconnect the component itself.  And strip out all the modules we no longer need.  We are left with a nice simple UI rendering component.

Reload the application and make sure everything is running smoothly under you new saga based setup.

## Spying on our Sagas

Before we move on, let's look at the yield values of our saga thus far.  I'm going to assign our worker saga `instantiateBook` to our browser's window object, so I can do some quick examples in the console.  Let's look at just the worker and see what happens as we manually manage its iterator function.

![Instantiate Book Iterator](/images/7/SagaGeneratorExample.png)

First, just as we did in our generator examples at the start of this chapter, I am calling the generator and assigning the returned iterator to a variable, `saga`.

When I invoke `saga.next` the first time, the code runs up to our first yield statement, and in this case, our first side effect.  Our side effects always return simple objects, which are in turn managed by our middleware.  I'm using `JSON.stringify` to make the example more readable.  But you can see the object details the side effect redux saga should use (`call`), and the information needed to manage the call.

Now that next time we invoke `saga.next` we are assigning the returned value of our yield to the `response` variable.  This means our generator will expect `next` to be invoked with a return value.  In this case a response object, with an attribute `data` which will contain a list of nodes returned from our API.  This time, when we invoke `next` with the return data, our generator resumes running after the first yield, and runs to the next, which contains our use of the `put` effect.  

Our generator again returns a JavaScript object for our middleware with instructions on how to perform the `put` effect.  In this case, dispatching our action `loadNodes` to the store.

We're taking this pause to help you understand how the saga middleware is managing our generators to orchestrate asynchronous actions like our API call.  And how we can control the next steps the generator takes by altering the value given to `next` when the iterator is advanced.  This is essentially the same strategy we’ll be using to implement tests against our generators.

## Managing the Chapter Load

Let's add in the request for our chapters so that we can remove that API code from our components as well.

``` javascript
import { takeEvery, put, call } from 'redux-saga/effects';
import axios from 'axios';

import * as routes from '../constants/settings';
import { loadNodes } from '../actions/nodes';
import { loadChapters } from '../actions/chapters';

export function* instantiateBook(){
  try{
    const response = yield call(axios.get,'/api/nodes');
    const chapterResponse = yield call(axios.get,'/api/chapters');
    yield put(loadNodes(response.data));
    yield put(loadChapters(chapterResponse.data));
    
  }
  catch(e){
    console.log(e);
  }
} 

export function* watchBookRoutesSaga(){
  yield takeEvery([routes.HOME_ROUTE, routes.CHAPTER_ROUTE], instantiateBook);
};
```

Now, we can update our `controlled_chapter_menu_items.js` container since we'll no longer need it to dispatch our load action.

``` javascript
import { connect } from 'react-redux';

import ChapterMenuItems from '../components/chapter_menu_items';
import { routeChapter } from '../actions/routes';

const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
  active_chapter: state.chapters.find(
   (chapter) => chapter.id === state.settings.active_chapter_id
  ),
  chapters: state.chapters
});

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => ({
  dispatchRouteChapter: (event,target) => dispatch(routeChapter(target.value))
});

export default connect(mapStateToProps,mapDispatchToProps)(ChapterMenuItems);
```

And the `chapter_menu_items.js` component can be updated as well to remove our API related code.

``` javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Dropdown } from 'semantic-ui-react';

export default class ChapterMenuItems extends Component {
  renderChapterOptions = () => {
    let chapters_list = [];
    this.props.chapters.forEach((chapter) => {
      chapters_list.push(
        { 
          key: "chapter_" + chapter.id,
          id:  "chapter_menu_item_" + chapter.id,
          value: chapter.id,
          text: chapter.title,
          active: chapter.id === this.props.active_chapter.id
        }
      );
    });
    return chapters_list;
  }
  
  render() {
    if(this.props.chapters !== [] && this.props.active_chapter){
      return( 
        <Dropdown 
          tabIndex="1"
          placeholder="Jump to Chapter..."
          className="link item"
          selectOnNavigation={false}
          value={this.props.active_chapter.id}
          text={this.props.active_chapter.title}
          onChange={this.props.dispatchRouteChapter}
          options={this.renderChapterOptions()} 
        />
      );
    } else {
      return null;
    }
  }
}
```

Allow the application to reload, and your sagas should now be fully managing the instantiation of our book contents.  We can still make some improvements though.

If you look at the network tab of your browser, you'll see evidence of the weakness of the code above.  Because yield surrenders control of execution until the API call is resolved, our two task are running in sequence; first the API call for nodes fires, and our generator waits for a response.  Then the API is queried again for our chapters, and again waits for a response.

If you look at the timing of the network requests, you can see this bear out.  In one test I ran, my `/api/nodes` request was able to start at ~900ms, while the request for chapters was delayed to 1.6 seconds.

![Nodes Sequenced Request](/images/7/NodesSequenceRequest.png)
![Chapters Sequenced Request](/images/7/ChaptersSequenceRequest.png)

### Running Requests in Parallel

If we rework our Saga a bit we can run these requests in parallel using a side effect we've mentioned before in our rootSaga, but did not really explain.

The `all` effect will allow us to run an array of tasks is parallel, and our saga will not advance until all of the requests are resolved.  Or if one of the request fails, the entire saga will end in an error.

``` javascript
import { takeEvery, put, call, all } from 'redux-saga/effects';
import axios from 'axios';

import * as routes from '../constants/settings';
import { loadNodes } from '../actions/nodes';
import { loadChapters } from '../actions/chapters';

export function* instantiateBook(){
  try{
    const [nodes, chapters] = yield all([
      call(axios.get,'/api/nodes'),
      call(axios.get,'/api/chapters')
    ]);
    
    yield all([
      put(loadNodes(nodes.data)),
      put(loadChapters(chapters.data))
    ]);
  }
  catch(e){
    console.log(e);
  }
} 

export function* watchBookRoutesSaga(){
  yield takeEvery([routes.HOME_ROUTE, routes.CHAPTER_ROUTE], instantiateBook);
};
```

Now when I check my network request I see each request going out at the same time (and the whole process of our saga wrapping up more quickly I might add).

There's something else though... flip between a few different chapters.  What’s happening?  We tied this saga to the `CHAPTER_ROUTE` dispatch, so that if someone came into our application on a link to a specific chapter we'd still instantiate the book.  But once we've done that, it would be nice if we didn't continue to harass the API for that same information over and over again.

Don't worry, there's an effect for that.

### Checking Store Values in a Saga

Let's add a check to the beginning of our saga to check if we actually need to fire those API requests again.

``` javascript
import { takeEvery, select, put, call, all } from 'redux-saga/effects';
import axios from 'axios';

import * as routes from '../constants/settings';
import { loadNodes } from '../actions/nodes';
import { loadChapters } from '../actions/chapters';

export function* instantiateBook(){
  const dehydrated = yield select((state) =>{
    return !(state.chapters.length && state.nodes.length)
  });
  
  if(dehydrated){
    try{
      const [nodes, chapters] = yield all([
        call(axios.get,'/api/nodes'),
        call(axios.get,'/api/chapters')
      ]);
      
      yield all([
        put(loadNodes(nodes.data)),
        put(loadChapters(chapters.data))
      ]);
    }
    catch(e){
      console.log(e);
    }
  }
} 

export function* watchBookRoutesSaga(){
  yield takeEvery([routes.HOME_ROUTE, routes.CHAPTER_ROUTE], instantiateBook);
};
```

The `select` effect will invoke a selector function you define for it, which will be given access to our current store state.  In our example, we're using select to check if either `nodes` or `chapters` has a length of 0 (falsely), and if so flagging our book as "dehydrated".  If the saga advances in this dehydrated state, then it will execute our API queries. 

One last thing though, let's set up our selector function as a standalone exportable so it's easier to grab for testing.

``` javascipt
export const checkBookHydration = (state) => {
    return !(state.chapters.length && state.nodes.length)
  }

export function* instantiateBook(){
  const dehydrated = yield select(checkBookHydration);
  
  //Remainder of module hidden
}
```

## Sagas Shine in Testing

We have our API interactions successfully migrated into our Saga.  Now we should probably put this under test before we move on.

Before we touch our saga, let's write some tests for our selector function.  When we test our saga actions, we'll be feeding `next()` with the expected return values of each yield.  This means the actual logic of our selector function won't be under test unless we explicitly test that code in isolation.  Since it took me about 4 tries to get the logic test write when I wrote it... I should probably test it.

``` javascript
import { checkBookHydration } from './instantiate_book';

describe("checkBookHydration", ()=>{
  const cases = [
    {state: {nodes: [], chapters: [] }, outcome: true},
    {state: {nodes: ["populated"], chapters: [] }, outcome: true},
    {state: {nodes: [], chapters: ["populated"] }, outcome: true},
    {state: {nodes: ["populated"], chapters: ["populated"] }, outcome: false}
  ];
  
  cases.forEach((test_case) =>{
    test("provides expected outcome", () =>{
      expect(checkBookHydration(test_case.state)).toEqual(test_case.outcome);
    });
  });
});
```

We're using a trick we haven't seen so far for Jest.  I'm creating an Array of sample data, and using the Array.forEach method to apply an assertion to each member.  We're supplying sample data, and our expected outcome to each test run.  In this case, we expect our selector to return true on any state where it encounters at least one empty Array.

Now, let's actually move on to our Saga itself.

``` javascript
/* global expect */
import { instantiateBook, checkBookHydration } from './instantiate_book';
import { select } from 'redux-saga/effects';

// Selector tests hidden

describe("instantiateBook", () =>{
  var saga = instantiateBook();
  
  test("begins by checking hydration of book nodes/chapters",() =>{
    expect(saga.next().value).toMatchObject(select(checkBookHydration))
  })
  
  test("ends saga if book is not dehydrated",() => {
    expect(saga.next(false).done).toEqual(true);
  })
});
```

We're going to be pacing through our generator using the `next` method of our returned iterator.  Notice that when I setup my test in the `describe` block, I am purposefully **not** using a `forEach` block.  We don't want the test to tear down and reset our generator back to the beginning each time we test an assertion.  Instead our test will be one continuing stream for the saga.

To begin, we're testing the first return of `saga.next()`, and it's value should be our call to the `select` effect.  Remember that the saga middleware is going to handle the actual execution of this effect, we just need to verify our saga is dictating the correct effects at each step of the journey.  Therefore, we test the value of `saga.next().value`, against the expectation that it will contain an object representing the `select` effect, and using our `checkBookHydration` selector method as its selector function.

The next test moves the saga forward again.  This time we're supplying a value into `next()`, this is essentially a mock for your saga.  We don't need the service to be mocked to actually execute our `select` effect, we just need to know that if the saga gets a certain value passed back to `yield` that it performs the next step we expect.  If this case, if the test for dehydration proves false, we expect the saga to be done.  So we can test that the object returned is marked `done: true`.

Now we have a problem though.  We just resolved our generator.  But we didn't test the dehydrated branch.  We could start the next test by setting up a new iterator, and invoking `saga.next()` and then `saga.next(true)`.  That would effectively start us over at the beginning of the saga.  But it would also be a real headache, and not a very clear test.

Luckily, redux-saga ships with a helper method we can use to make this easier, `cloneableGenerator`.  Let's look at that helper in action.

``` javascipt
/* global expect */
import { instantiateBook, checkBookHydration } from './instantiate_book';
import { cloneableGenerator } from 'redux-saga/utils';
import { select, all, call, put } from 'redux-saga/effects';
import axios from 'axios';

import { loadNodes } from '../actions/nodes';
import { loadChapters } from '../actions/chapters';

// Selector tests hidden

describe("instantiateBook", () => {
  var saga = {}
  saga.gen = cloneableGenerator(instantiateBook)();
  
  test("begins by checking hydration of book nodes/chapters",() => {
    expect(saga.gen.next().value).toMatchObject(select(checkBookHydration))
    saga.dehydrated = saga.gen.clone();
    saga.hydrated = saga.gen.clone();
  })
  
  describe("BRANCH dehydration === false ", ()=> {
    test("ends saga",() => {
      expect(saga.hydrated.next(false).done).toEqual(true);
    });
  });
  
  describe("BRANCH dehydration === true", ()=> {
    test("begins /api/nodes && api/chapters requests", ()=> {
      expect(saga.dehydrated.next(true).value).toEqual(all([
        call(axios.get,'/api/nodes'),
        call(axios.get,'/api/chapters')
      ]));
    });
    
    test("dispatches loadNodes and loadChapters with returned data", ()=> {
      let [nodes, chapters] = [
        {data: [{content: "Test node"}]},
        {data: [{title: "Test Chapter"}]}
      ];
      
      expect(saga.dehydrated.next([nodes, chapters]).value).toEqual(all([
        put(loadNodes(nodes.data)),
        put(loadChapters(chapters.data))
      ]));
    });
  });
});
```

When we setup our generator, we are instantiating it will the utility method `cloneableGenerator` which will allow us to clone a snapshot of our generator’s current state at any time.  Our first test proceeds as normal, but before we close the test we are setting up for the branch split in our tests.  I prefer to keep all my saga branches in an object, so that I can use the dot-naming syntax to give a descriptor of where each saga is in its lifecycle.  Therefor the branches I create will be called `hydrated` and `dehydrated`.

We then open a new describe block for each branch, and carry our testing forward.  The false branch only has one additional test ensuring our generator is marked finished after we prove our book state to be hydrated.

The `dehydrated` branch will begin by testing that our API calls are made if `dehydrated == true`.  As we did with our first `select` test, we are invoking the same effects we expect the generator to use in our tests, and comparing the objects returned.  In this case, using `all` and several `call` generators.

The `dehydrated` branch then advances again, this time ensuring that our `loadChapters` and `loadNodes` actions are both dispatched to our store when yielded data from our API calls.

That gives us a pretty solid test for our saga.  The only thing missing is a test for our errors branch.  Since we're console logging this error, we are getting some pollution in our test reports when our App component get mounted and attempts to make these API calls and fails.  We'll clean this up as we consider how to handle displaying these messages in our application.

## Wrapping Up

This chapter was essentially a refactor of our application.  We didn’t come away with any new features to show for our efforts, but a fundamental piece of our application architecture is now being handle in a much more scalable, and testable manner.  Between Redux, Redux First Router, and Redux Saga we have our entire application built to make our store the single system of record for our application.  Now the fun begins, to this point the amount of state we actually manage has been minimal, and it’s arguable we probably could have built this application easily in vanilla Rails.  

Now that the groundwork is laid, we can start thinking about more complex state change on the client-side, and build some features that will really make our application shine.  See you in chapter 8!
