# Chapter 0: Introduction

Welcome to my book I guess.  Sitting down to write this tonight I'm not entirely sure what I have to offer to you in writting this.  I want to come right out and say from the beginning that I consider myself a midling programmer at best for both React and Rails.  What I know I've self-taught, and I don't have any claim to say that the way I've formed my habbits constitutes a best-practice.  You may encounter thing if you move forward that are not even **good** practice.  But they are what has worked for me.

What I can say is that when I started learning I was frustrated with the resources available.  It was eay to find guides, and books about the individual skills I was interested in learning.  The Rails and React community both are vibrant, and there are no shortage of quality resources for learning available to you.  But what I struggled to find was any one cohesive bookthat helped me pull all of the pieces together.

I've always been the type of learner that needs to understand the whole, before I can begin to understand or enjoy something component parts.  So trying to cobble together a working whole from admittedly fantastic guides on small parts of the puzzle worked against the way my brain seems to be wired.  

So now I'm seeking to build the resource I wish I had when I started.

I'm also hoping this exercise will help me devlop a deeper understanding of the tools I am using.  And I hope to create a tool in the process I can be proud of.

## So, what are we building?

Together (In a non-linear timey-wimey sense), we are going to build a web-reading for books, like this one, written in Markdown language.  

Why?  A few reasons.  First of all I enjoy the easy syntax and accessibility of Markdown.  Particularrly for a book that needs to be packed full of code examples, and images.  Markdown gives developers and easy way to write documentation for their code, and it's widely used in README.md files attached to projects all accross the web.  Some of these README files, border on small books in an of themselves.  And I think we can build a web-reader in React that will make this format shine as a teaching tool for coding topics.

There's also the small detail that I'm embarking on this project alone.  I don't have an edittor to tell me what's good, what's bad, what should stay and go.  I'm bound to make mistakes.  Even the thing I'm getting right, will need to be revisited, and updated as the ecosystem changes.

So I'm embarking to write this book in Markdown files as I go.  And I'll be commiting the book's contents to its own GitHub as I go.  My hope, is that if someone actually reads this some day, we might form a community to revise and maintain this book.  Open source version controled editting.  

And since we'll be embarking to build a web-reader for just such Markdown books as we move through this exercise together, everything ties up nicely.  That's just the kind of meta, eat-your-own-dogfood synergy the kids are crazy about these days.

## What you need to know

Before we can begin, we need to talk about what we won't be covering in this book.  For the sake of getting started, I'm going to assume that readers will have at least some basic familiarity with React and Rails both as standalone tools.  If that's not the case, I'm going to recommend that you start elsewhere and revisit this book later.

I'll also be leaving heavily on Redux in the client-side of this application for managment of state.  And where I need additional tools beyond React/Redux, you'll find me favoring tools that keep Redux at the forefront for all things related to application state.  I may forgoe the use of some tools that are the highly favored among React developers, in favor of implementations I prefer for their tight integration with Redux.

So if you've not had some basic exposure to any of these tools, it might be worth a diversion to look at these tools in isolation before diving in.

My three favorites are:
1. The [Agile Development with Rails](https://pragprog.com/book/rails5/agile-web-development-with-rails-5) series is still the gold standard in my opinion for starting with Rails.  I've bought at least 3 major versions of this book over the years, and it continues to be a top-notch resource.
2. [Learning React: A Hands-On Guide to Building Maintainable, High-Performing Web Application User Interfaces Using the React JavaScript Library](https://www.amazon.com/Learning-React-Hands-Maintainable-High-Performing-ebook/dp/B01N5GPFM2/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1502339479&sr=1-1-fkmr0&keywords=learning+React%3A+A+Hands-On+Guide+to+Buildi) was my entry point into React, and I think it does as especially good job of highlighting the strengths of React, and giving introduction to the **very** large ecosystem that stems from it, without overwhelming beginners.
3. And finally, [The Complete Redux Book](https://leanpub.com/redux-book) is a great introduction to Redux.  This book is a powerful little workhorse, just like the tool it covers.  It's compact, and I move through it in a single night's read when I first picked it up.  But it's been a valuable resource that I revisit frequently.
 
## And a look ahead...

At the time I'm sitting down to freewrite this first pass at chapter 0, Rails 5.1 is just coming onto the scene with enhanced support for using front-end JavaScript libraries through the asset pipeline.

There are also major projects like react-rails that can be used to integrate the two tools.

For my part, I'm going to be ignoring both of them.  Because frankly I just don't think there is a need for them.  As you'll see soon, getting these two tools to play nicely together is a minimal task of configuration, and I think there is a lot to be said for keeping some seperation of concerns between the two tools.  Each framework is fairly opinionated about the way things should be done.  And luckily for us, there is not much overlap in those concerns.  Running a front-end application in React, and backing it up with an API built on Rails gives us a clean line of seperation between tools.  And gives us the opportunity to learn these tools on their own merit.

This also let's us embrace enhanced support in Rails 5 for API only applications.  

And that API backend lends itself nicely to the Flux (FSA) architecture that drives Redux, and by extension React.

My point is not to say other tools, or approaches don't have merit.  But if you're starting out, I advise taking the time to learn the tools individuallly.  Then you can make an informed decision about where other approaches can save you time.
