# Chapter 9: High Order Components

This chapter we refactor some of our container components with an eye on increasing their reusability.  To do this, we will be transforming our container for chapters into a High Order Component so that we can reuse the connection to our chapter state across several components.

We also establish a new container for an `alerts` state, which we will use to establish some early error handling in our client.

## Jumping in Here

If you have not been following along with code examples and want to jump in here, you can use our [Chapter8Starter](https://github.com/swachtma/reactivating-rails-app/tree/Chapter8Starter) branch as a place to join in.

## Composing Components (HOCS)

One area that has been troubling me with our design is our `ChapterMenuItems` component.  I still dislike that our component, which is almost entirely logic free, is still in charge of checking `active_chapter` is defined before rendering.  I would like this check moved into our container, encapsulating all of our store logic there.

I have also been thinking that the footer of each of our chapters should have a link to the next chapter.  That way a reader does not need to use the drop-down menu to advance the chapter as they read.  The requirements of such a link component are going to be very similar to the `ChapterMenuItems` component, so it would be nice if they could share a connection to the store.

To do this, I am going to change my container so that it composes a new component with a function, and use that function to perform the logic tests related to rendering.  If the container can provide everything we need for the render, our composed component can render a child element (our final component) and pass along the props needed.

Components constructed by functions this way are named "High Order Components."  Although, in my experience, they often contain connections to our Redux store, so referring to them as “High Order Containers” might also be accurate.

## Composing our first High Order Component

Let’s begin our refactor of the chapter’s container, and we can talk through the modifications as we move along.  I am going to rename our file `controlled_chapter_menu_items.js` to `chapters_provider.js` to better reflect its new use; I suggest you do the same.

``` javascript(/reactive-client/src/containers/chapter_provider.js)
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import React from 'react';

import ChapterMenuItems from '../components/chapter_menu_items';
import { routeChapter } from '../actions/routes';

+ export const connectToChapters = (WrappedComponent) => {
+    return connect(mapStateToProps,mapDispatchToProps)(chapterProvider(WrappedComponent));
+ };

+ const chapterProvider = (WrappedComponent) => {
+   return class extends React.Component {
+     render(){
+       if(this.props.chapters !== [] && this.props.active_chapter){
+         return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} />;
+         
+       } else {
+         return null;
+       }
+     }
+   };
};

const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
  active_chapter: state.chapters.find(
   (chapter) => chapter.id === state.settings.active_chapter_id
  ),
  chapters: state.chapters
});

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => ({
  dispatchRouteChapter: (event,target) => dispatch(routeChapter(target.value))
});

// EXPORTABLE CONNECTED COMPONENTS
+ export const ConnectedChapterMenuItems = connectToChapters(ChapterMenuItems);
```

High Orders Components (HOCs) are functions which return new React components, and they are handy for sharing logic among several different components.

Let's start with what's familiar; our connect function.  We have changed our use of `connect` to now call a function `chapterProvider(WrappedComponent)` instead of a component.  We know that connect expects to be passed a component though, so that gives us our first big clue about just what `chapterProvider` is doing.

Step inside the chapterProvider function, and you see it immediately calls return.  That return is going to construct a new React component for us.  Inside, we are setting up a new component almost precisely as we have seen in the past.  We have moved our logic test for the presence of `chapters` and `active_chapter` inside this newly constructed component.

Our HOC relies on the fact that it is going to be called through connect to receive the props `chapters` and `active_chapter`.  It performs a test to see that both values are available; if not, it simply returns `null` when the component renders.  If the props are available, then it takes the given `WrappedComponent` parameter and returns that as its render value.  We use `{...this.props} to ensure that any props given to our HOC, get passed through to the rendered component.  This step of passing through props is necessary because our function sends back the anonymous constructed component to `connect`.  That means that the anonymous component is where our props land after being provided by our store.  We are using the spread operator to ensure all props pass through to the final component we are trying to render.

This sets our HOC up as the perfect place to perform testing to ensure that we are ready to render.  Also, since the test lives in a function, we can reuse this logical test easily to render other components dependent on our chapter's information.  All we need to do is pass through a different component.

Finally, we create a new exportable value `ConnectedChapterMenuItems`, which provides our `ChapterMenuItems` component to `connectToChapters`, and returns our connected component.  It is worth noting that you could also export `connectToChapters` where you plan to use the connected component (in our case this would be inside `MenuBar`).  However, I prefer to set it up here as an exportable, so that as my list of components using this HOC grows, I have them all assembled in one place.

Now we can make some updates to `ChapterMenuItems` to remove the rendering logic we no longer need.

``` javascript(/reactive-client/src/components/chapter_menu_items.js)
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Dropdown } from 'semantic-ui-react';

export default class ChapterMenuItems extends Component {
  renderChapterOptions = () => {
    let chapters_list = [];
    this.props.chapters.forEach((chapter) => {
      chapters_list.push(
        { 
          key: "chapter_" + chapter.id,
          id:  "chapter_menu_item_" + chapter.id,
          value: chapter.id,
          text: chapter.title,
          active: chapter.id === this.props.active_chapter.id
        }
      );
    });
    return chapters_list;
  }
  
  render() {
    return( 
        <Dropdown 
          tabIndex="1"
          placeholder="Jump to Chapter..."
          className="link item"
          selectOnNavigation={false}
          value={this.props.active_chapter.id}
          text={this.props.active_chapter.title}
          onChange={this.props.dispatchRouteChapter}
          options={this.renderChapterOptions()} 
        />
      );
  }
}
```

We also need to update `MenuBar` to use our new `ConnectedChapterMenuItems` component.

``` javascript(/reactive-client/src/components/menu_bar.js)
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Container, Image, Menu } from 'semantic-ui-react';
import reactLogo from '../assets/images/react-logo.svg';
import railsLogo from '../assets/images/rails-logo.svg';

+ import { ConnectedChapterMenuItems } from '../containers/chapter_provider';

const fixedMenuStyle = {
  backgroundColor: '#fff',
  border: '1px solid #ddd',
  boxShadow: '0px 3px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)',
  paddingTop: "13px",
  paddingBottom: "13px"
};

const tightItem = {
  paddingTop: "0",
  paddingBottom: "0"
}

class MenuBar extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
        <Menu
          id="menu_bar"
          borderless
          stackable
          fixed="top"
          style={ fixedMenuStyle }
        >
          <Container textAlign="center">
            <Menu.Item className="banner" style={tightItem}>
              <Image size='mini' src={reactLogo} />
              <Image size='mini' src={railsLogo} />
              <Menu.Item header>Reactivating Rails: A work in progress</Menu.Item>
            </Menu.Item>

            <Menu.Menu position='right' style={tightItem} value={this.props.active_chapter}>
+               <ConnectedChapterMenuItems />
            </Menu.Menu>
          </Container>
        </Menu>
    );
  }
}

export default MenuBar;
```

## Reusability of High Order Components

Now let's build a footer chapter link to demonstrate the reusability of our new HOC, and improve our UX as well.  First though, when I told you that Redux-First-Router was modularized, I was not kidding.  To create a link using the provided link helper we need to install that module: `npm install --save redux-first-router-link`.

Now let's set up the Component first, creating a new file `src/components/chapter_footer.js`

``` javascript(/reactive-client/src/components/chapter_footer.js)
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import Link from 'redux-first-router-link';

import * as routes from '../constants/settings.js';

const chapter_footer_style = {
  margin: "15px 0",
  textAlign: "center",
};

class ChapterFooter extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div id="chapter-footer-link" style={chapter_footer_style}>
        <h2>
          <Link to={{type: routes.CHAPTER_ROUTE, payload: {chapter_id: this.props.active_chapter.id + 1}}}>
            Next Chapter
          </Link>
        </h2>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default ChapterFooter;
```

The `Link` Component from Redux First Route allows us to use several formats to describe our link destinations.  We can provide a route such as `chapter/6`, or a full FSA as seen above.  We can also tie the action to a dispatch function connected to our store, but there is an SEO upside to using one of the first two options as our link then contains a route path, rather than tying the action to an onClick handler.

I prefer the FSA route because if our paths change, we can update our action creators, and avoid needing to change links in a slew of places.  We are hard writing the FSA into our component for now as an example, but we can change to an action creator in a moment.

Now we need to connect this component through our provider.

``` javascript(/reactive-client/src/containers/chapter_provider.js)
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import React from 'react';

import ChapterMenuItems from '../components/chapter_menu_items';
+ import ChapterFooter from '../components/chapter_footer';
import { routeChapter } from '../actions/routes';

export const connectToChapters = (WrappedComponent) => {
   return connect(mapStateToProps,mapDispatchToProps)(chapterProvider(WrappedComponent));
};

const chapterProvider = (WrappedComponent) => {
  return class extends React.Component {
    render(){
      if(this.props.chapters !== [] && this.props.active_chapter){
        return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} />;
        
      } else {
        return null;
      }
    }
  };
};

const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
  active_chapter: state.chapters.find(
   (chapter) => chapter.id === state.settings.active_chapter_id
  ),
  chapters: state.chapters
});

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => ({
  dispatchRouteChapter: (event,target) => dispatch(routeChapter(target.value))
});

// EXPORTABLE CONNECTED COMPONENTS
export const ConnectedChapterMenuItems = connectToChapters(ChapterMenuItems);
+ export const ConnectedChapterFooterLink = connectToChapters(ChapterFooter);
```

Now we can use this new exportable inside our `ReaderPane`.  (Note: I am also updating our styles on this component a bit.)

``` javascript(/reactive-client/src/components/reader_pane.js)
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Container } from 'semantic-ui-react';
+ import { ConnectedChapterFooterLink } from '../containers/chapter_provider';

+ const reader_pane_styles= {
+   paddingBottom: "15px"
+ };

class ReaderPane extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div id="reader-pane" style={ reader_pane_styles }>
        <Container text>
        { this.props.children }
+         <ConnectedChapterFooterLink />
        </Container>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default ReaderPane;
```

Let's go ahead and take a look at this first simple pass.

![Simple Footer Link](/images/8/SimpleFooterLink.png)


## Extensibility of High Order Components

Our footer link is OK for a first pass, but I think it would be better to give the title of the next chapter in the link text, rather than a simple "Next" message.  Also, when we reach the end of the book, we should not advertise a link for moving on to a chapter that doesn't exist.

Let's add some additional props to our container so we can make these extensions.

``` javascript(/reactive-client/src/containers/chapter_provider.js)
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import React from 'react';

import ChapterMenuItems from '../components/chapter_menu_items';
import ChapterFooter from '../components/chapter_footer';
import { routeChapter } from '../actions/routes';

export const connectToChapters = (WrappedComponent) => {
   return connect(mapStateToProps,mapDispatchToProps)(chapterProvider(WrappedComponent));
};

const chapterProvider = (WrappedComponent) => {
  return class extends React.Component {
    render(){
      if(this.props.chapters !== [] && this.props.active_chapter){
        return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} />;
        
      } else {
        return null;
      }
    }
  };
};

const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
  active_chapter: state.chapters.find(
   (chapter) => chapter.id === state.settings.active_chapter_id
  ),
  
+   next_chapter: state.chapters.find(
+   (chapter) => chapter.id === state.settings.active_chapter_id + 1
+   ),
  
  chapters: state.chapters
});

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => ({
  dispatchRouteChapter: (event,target) => dispatch(routeChapter(target.value))
});

// EXPORTABLE CONNECTED COMPONENTS
export const ConnectedChapterMenuItems = connectToChapters(ChapterMenuItems);
export const ConnectedChapterFooterLink = connectToChapters(ChapterFooter);
```

We set up `next_chapter` much the same way we did `active_chapter`.  We are going to pass a complete chapter object, rather than a simple ID, this way we have the title available as well.

Now let's update our ChapterFooter component to make use of this new prop.

``` javascript(/reactive-client/src/components/chapter_footer.js)
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import Link from 'redux-first-router-link';

import * as actions from '../actions/routes.js';

const chapter_footer_style = {
  margin: "30px 0",
  textAlign: "center",
};

class ChapterFooter extends Component {
  
+   renderLinkOrThanks = (next_chapter) => {
+     let thanks = "The End - Thank you for Reading!";
+     return next_chapter ? 
+       <Link to={actions.routeChapter(next_chapter.id)}>Next - {next_chapter.title}</Link> : thanks;
+   }
  
  render() {
    return (
      <div id="chapter-footer-link" style={chapter_footer_style}>
        <h2>
+           { this.renderLinkOrThanks(this.props.next_chapter) }
        </h2>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default ChapterFooter;
```

We have made a couple of changes here.  First, we are now using our action creator function for our routes inside the `Link` component. 

We have also added a new method to the component `renderLinkOrThanks`.  This method checks whether a `next_chapter` prop is available, and then either prints our `Link`, or a thank you message to our readers.  (Because I do appreciate you choosing to read this, and I hope the text serves you well).

We could have made this data selection for `next_chapter` inside of our footer component to the same result.  However, doing it in our container makes that logic available to all of our connected components.  Even if we do not use all the props given by our provider in every component I still prefer to have my data selection/filtering done inside a central location.  I find myself thinking of containers much the same way I do my Active Record models; you could perform your data operations in a view, but you probably shouldn’t.

## Handling Errors and Messaging in our Client

We have not done much in the way of error reporting up until this point, and frankly, that is because we have not really needed it.  Right now, the only thing I can see going wrong with our application is a failure to instantiate our book contents.  If instantiation goes off without a problem, the rest of our application should be pretty much bulletproof.

However, as we expand our functionality, there will be more and more need to report messages to our users so that they stay informed of state changes, problems, helpful hints, etc.  I want to lay the groundwork for this messaging now so that we have it available to us in future iterations when we should be making use of it.

Thinking about what I need from this system, this is what I come up with:
* Not all alerts are negative; I would like the system to support positive, neutral, and error messages through the same system.
* Alerts should be contextual for the area of the application that triggered them.  (hypothetically if we need to alert about an error with a form the error should appear in/near that element)
* Alerts should be attributed to an "application" area/level by default if a more specific scope is unavailable.
* Alerts should clear on a route change, that way they do not linger past when they are valid.

I am going to define my action creator first in `src/actions/alerts.js`.

``` javascript(/reactive-client/src/actions/alerts.js)
import * as constants from "../constants/alerts";

export const addAlert = (message, level = constants.lvls[0], scope = constants.scopes[0]) => ({
  type: constants.ADD_ALERT, payload: {message, level, scope, timestamp: Date.now()}
});

export const clearAlerts = () => ({ type: constants.CLEAR_ALERTS }) ;
```

Our action creators should be becoming second nature at this point.  The only new element in `addAlert` is the use of function default parameters to assign a value to `scope` and `level` if we do not want to specify a value.  I have also used `Date.now()` to create a timestamp for each alert.  We are likely going to print these as lists to the screen, and React requires a unique `key` property for each element when we print it from a collection.  Since we do not have an Active Record ID available for these alerts, the timestamp serves.  It also has the bonus of allowing us to order alerts chronologically should the need arise.

I am also defining a set list of values in our constants file which we can use in both our action creators and reducer.

``` javascript(/reactive-client/src/constants/alerts.js)
export const ADD_ALERT = "ADD_ALERT";
export const CLEAR_ALERTS = "CLEAR_ALERTS";

// Enumerated Values, default array[0] in reducer & actionCreators
export const scopes = ["application"];
export const lvls = ["info","warning","success","danger"];
```

Now we need a reducer connected to our store.  Notice that I am enforcing the default values for our alerts inside the reducer.  When I first wrote this, I confess I had our action creator doing this enforcement of our `scope` and `level` enumerated values.  It was not until I started writing my reducer that it occurred to me that nothing stopped me from dispatching an action directly to the store without using the action creator.  If we want to enforce a data format on our store, it needs to live inside our reducer.  Thus the `normalizeAlert` function resides here.

``` javascript(/reactive-client/src/reducers/alerts.js)
import * as constants from '../constants/alerts';
const default_state = [];

export const normalizeAlert = (payload) => {
  payload.scope = constants.scopes.includes(payload.scope) ? payload.scope : constants.scopes[0];
  payload.level = constants.lvls.includes(payload.level) ? payload.level : constants.lvls[0];
  return payload;
};

const alertsReducer = function(state = default_state,action){
  switch (action.type) {
    case(constants.ADD_ALERT):
+       return [...state, normalizeAlert(action.payload)]
    case(constants.CLEAR_ALERTS):
      return [];
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

export default alertsReducer;
```

We have not really seen a case statement pattern like; `return [...state, normalizeAlert(action.payload)]` in any of our previous reducers.  This syntax though is one of the easiest ways to append new items to an array in our state.  Using the literal syntax, combined with the spread operator; we easily carry over the existing values in our state, as the spread operator applies all the existing members to the new array instance. Then we append the new value to the end of the array after it returns from our `normalizeAlert` function.

The second case of our switch statement (`CLEAR_ALERTS`) resets our store to an empty Array.

Don't forget to add this reducer to your `combineReducers` function inside of `store.js` before moving forward.

### Leveraging our Alerts Reducer

Now I want to modify a few of my existing scripts to leverage this new alert structure for error reporting to our users.  Let's start with our instantiate book saga.

``` javascript(/reactive-client/src/sagas/instantiate_book.js)
import { takeEvery, select, put, call, all } from 'redux-saga/effects';
import axios from 'axios';

import * as routes from '../constants/settings';
import { loadNodes } from '../actions/nodes';
import { loadChapters } from '../actions/chapters';
+ import { addAlert } from '../actions/alerts';

export const checkBookHydration = (state) => {
    return !(state.chapters.length && state.nodes.length)
  }

export function* instantiateBook(){
  const dehydrated = yield select(checkBookHydration);
  
  if(dehydrated){
-     try{
-       const [nodes, chapters] = yield all([
-         call(axios.get,'/api/nodes'),
-         call(axios.get,'/api/chapters')
-       ]);
-       
-       yield all([
-         put(loadNodes(nodes.data)),
-         put(loadChapters(chapters.data))
-       ]);
-     }
+     catch(e){
+       yield put(addAlert(
        "We were unable to fetch the latest copy of this book at this time. " +
+         "Sorry for the inconvenience!  You can try refreshing your browser. " +
+         "Or returning to visit another time.",
+         "danger"
+       ));
+     }
  }
} 

window.instantiateBook = instantiateBook;

export function* watchBookRoutesSaga(){
  yield takeEvery([routes.HOME_ROUTE, routes.CHAPTER_ROUTE], instantiateBook);
};
```

We are adding our alert to the catch block of our saga.  Mind we could also return error values from our rails application and similarly log those errors.  For a more elaborate action, like a log-in, sharing an API error is probably the method I would take.  In a more complex action, several things might go wrong; our token could be invalid, expired, or have insufficient privileges.  We would want to give different messages to our users in each of these outcomes to guide them through correcting the problem.

With a fetch from our index actions, we are almost bulletproof, unless the API is offline or our routes incorrect.  In fact, that is what we will do to trigger the error on this saga...

Temporarily set your fetch of nodes to `call(axios.get,'/api/node')` instead of the correct `call(axios.get,'/api/nodes')`.

If we allow the application to load now, we can see our saga dispatch the alert message in our dev tools.

### Creating an Alerts HOC

Now let's set up our container.

``` javascript(/reactive-client/src/containers/alert_provider.js)
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import React from 'react';

import { scopes } from '../constants/alerts';
import AlertList from '../components/alert_list';

const alertProvider = (scope = scopes[0], WrappedComponent = AlertList) => {
  let mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
    alerts: state.alerts.filter((a) => a.scope === scope)
  });
  
  return connect(mapStateToProps,null)(WrappedComponent);
};

export default alertProvider;
```

We are taking a different approach with this HOC.  It might even be stretching the definition to call this a HOC.  The difference with this example is that we are letting `connect` do the heavy lifting of building our intermediary component inside the factory function.  However, we can still use a wrapping function to increase the flexibility of the module exported overall.

Here, we are passing in two parameters to our function.  The first, `scope` we supply with a default value from our constants file where we have defined our list of allowed values.  If we do not specify a value for scope, we default to "application".  If we want to use this container again in other more focused areas of our application, we might pass "login", or another value.  

The scope value is utilized in our `mapStateToProps` function to ensure the wrapped component only gains access to alerts with the matching scope value.

We are also passing a `WrappedComponent` property, which defaults to an `AlertList` component.  We use this default to print a list of messages to our UI.  We can also override this component if we need to.  We could for example pass in a login form component, and use a unique scope value to render alerts only about that form, or its elements.  

This approach to a HOC gives us the flexibility to reuse this connection to our alert state.  That encourages us to standardize how we handle these type of messages across our whole application.

### Printing Alerts

Let's go ahead and define the `AlertList` component.

``` javascript(/reactive-client/src/components/alert_list.js)
import React, { Component } from 'react';

const alertStyle = {
  padding: "15px",
  marginBottom: "20px",
  border: "1px solid transparent",
  borderRadius: "4px"
},

alertLevels = {
  info: {
    backgroundColor: "#d9edf7",
    borderColor: "#bce8f1",
    color: "#31708f"
  },
  warning: {
    backgroundColor: "#fcf8e3",
    borderColor: "#faebcc",
    color: "#8a6d3b"
  },
  success:{
    backgroundColor: "#dff0d8",
    borderColor: "#d6e9c6",
    color: "#3c763d"
  },
  danger: {
    backgroundColor: "#f2dede",
    borderColor: "#ebccd1",
    color: "#a94442"
  }
};

class AlertList extends Component {
  renderAlertMessages = (alerts) => {
    return alerts.map((a) => 
      <div 
        key={a.timestamp}
        className={"alert alert-" + a.level }
        style={Object.assign(alertStyle,alertLevels[a.level])}
        children={a.message}
      />
    );
  }
  
  render() {
    return (
      <div className={"alert_list_" + this.props.scope}>
        { this.renderAlertMessages(this.props.alerts) }
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default AlertList;
```

We are borrowing some styles from Bootstrap CSS here to produce bootstrap-like alert boxes for our default component.  Two reasons here... for one, I just happen like this alert message style, I think they are exceptionally done.  Also, the fact that bootstrap has normalized this look and feel through its vast popularity makes them even more useful in my opinion for alerting our users to valuable information.

I want to call attention to two approaches we can take to style our components here.  I have implemented self-contained styles in our JavaScript for this component.  We have defined a base style constant with the common attributes shared by all four alert levels.  Then I have set up a nested object with the unique styles for each of the variations (info, warning, danger, success).

When our component builds each message, it uses Object.assign to merge the base style, and the specific styles for each alert level into a single object and uses it to style our component.

However, you can also see this would have been easily done using Bootstrap's class syntax.  We simply call `className`, and use our alert's properties to set the `.alert` and `.alert-level` class names.  The downside is, we would then need to provide a bootstrap CSS file for our application.

All that is to say, you have got options, go with whatever style you enjoy using.

The last thing we need to take care of for this process is updating our application layout in `src/App.js`.

``` javascript(/reactive-client/src/App.js)
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import './App.css'

import ReaderPane from './components/reader_pane';
import MenuBar from './components/menu_bar';
import FilteredNodesList from './containers/filtered_nodes_list';
+ import connectToAlerts from './containers/alert_provider';
+ let ApplicationAlerts = connectToAlerts();

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div id="app">
        <MenuBar />
        <ReaderPane>
+           <ApplicationAlerts />
          <FilteredNodesList />
        </ReaderPane>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

Take note that we assign the return value of `connectToAlerts` to a variable, and then use the variable as a component inside our JSX.  This setup is a bit of my personal preference.  You could also just invoke your function inside the `render` method of the application component such as, `{ connectToAlerts() }`.  The net result would be the same.  I however like my JSX to be as uninterrupted as I can manage, so I like to isolate the function calls as shown in the example above.

Now, with our intentionally broken routes still in place inside our `instantiateBook` saga, let's look at what we have to show for our efforts.

![Application level alert message](/images/8/ApplicationAlert.png)

That looks pretty good to me.  We should not plan to win any design awards for the look and feel just yet, but we are moving in the right direction.

### Clearing Alerts with a Simple Saga

Before we wrap up, we should introduce a mechanism to clear these alerts, that way they do not pile up once we have more areas of our application pushing messages into this part of our state.

At the moment, clearing alerts on a route change seems like a wise place to start.  If we outgrow that solution in the future, we can always revisit it.

Create a new saga at `src/sagas/clear_alerts.js`.

``` javascript(/reactive-client/src/sagas/clear_alerts.js)
import { takeEvery, put } from 'redux-saga/effects';

import * as routes from '../constants/settings';
import { clearAlerts } from '../actions/alerts';

export function* watchRoutesToClearAlerts(){
+   yield takeEvery(Object.keys(routes), () => put(clearAlerts()));
}
```

Take a look, all we are doing is using `Object.keys` to link this saga to all of our route action types.  Then we do not even need a worker saga to pair with our watcher. Instead, we just pass an anonymous function which returns the put effect using our `clearAlerts` action creator.  Don't forget to add this new saga to your root saga before testing!

``` javascript(/reactive-client/src/sagas/root.js)
import { all } from 'redux-saga/effects';
import { watchBookRoutesSaga } from './instantiate_book';
+ import { watchRoutesToClearAlerts } from './clear_alerts';

export default function* rootSaga(){
  yield all([
    watchBookRoutesSaga(),
+     watchRoutesToClearAlerts()
  ]);
}
```

You have to test this one out on the console for now because we do not have many routes to pick from to change to, and none of them are accessible without an instantiated book.  But try loading a chapter route, then running `store.dispatch({type: "HOME_ROUTE"})` in the console.  You can see the alert flash as it clears from our state and is added again when the route again fails to load.  You can also double check your work in the action history of ReduxDevTools to ensure `CLEAR_ALERTS` dispatches as you would expect after the route change.

When you are satisfied everything is stitched together and working to your liking, restore the proper routes in your `instantiateBook` saga so that everything is back in working order.

## Closing out with Tests

The tests I have added to this chapter leverage the same strategies we have used in previous chapters, so we are going through them in detail.  They are included here though for context if you would like to review them, or copy them into your application.

``` javascript(/reactive-client/src/actions/alerts.spec.js)
/* global expect */
import * as actions from './alerts';

describe("Alerts actionCreators", ()=>{
  describe("addAlerts(message, level, scope)", ()=>{
    test("assigns defaults for scope and level", () =>{
      let fsa = actions.addAlert("hello world");
      expect(fsa.payload.scope).toBeDefined();
      expect(fsa.payload.level).toBeDefined();
    });
    
    test("matches snapshot", () =>{
      let snap = actions.addAlert("hello world");
      snap.payload.timestamp = 0;
      expect(snap).toMatchSnapshot();
    });
  });
  
  describe("clearAlerts()",()=>{
    test("matches snapshot", () =>{
      expect(actions.clearAlerts()).toMatchSnapshot();
    });
  });
});
```

``` javascript(/reactive-client/src/reducers/alerts.spec.js)
/* global expect */
import  alertsReducer, { normalizeAlert } from './alerts';
import * as actions from '../actions/alerts';

let defaultState = [];
let exampleState = [{message: "Test alert", level: "info", scope: "application", timestamp: 0}];

describe("alerts Reducer", ()=>{
  test("normalizeAlert enforces acceptable values for scope and level", ()=>{
    expect(normalizeAlert({message: "Test alert", timestamp: 0})).toEqual(exampleState[0]);
  });
  
  test("ADD_ALERT appends alert to array",()=>{
    let fsa = actions.addAlert("Test alert");
    fsa.payload.timestamp = 0;
    expect(alertsReducer(defaultState,fsa)).toEqual(exampleState);
  });
  
  test("CLEAR_ALERTS empties alerts array", () =>{
    expect(alertsReducer(exampleState, actions.clearAlerts())).toEqual([]);
  });
});
```

We should also add a red case branch for our `instantiateBook` saga's try/catch logic.  We can now add some testing to ensure we are dispatching an alert message if the instantiation fails.

``` javascript(/reactive-client/src/sagas/instantiate_book.spec.js)
/* global expect */
import { instantiateBook, checkBookHydration } from './instantiate_book';
import { cloneableGenerator } from 'redux-saga/utils';
import { select, all, call, put } from 'redux-saga/effects';
import axios from 'axios';

import { loadNodes } from '../actions/nodes';
import { loadChapters } from '../actions/chapters';
+ import { addAlert } from '../actions/alerts';

describe("checkBookHydration", ()=> {
  const cases = [
    {state: {nodes: [], chapters: [] }, outcome: true},
    {state: {nodes: ["populated"], chapters: [] }, outcome: true},
    {state: {nodes: [], chapters: ["populated"] }, outcome: true},
    {state: {nodes: ["populated"], chapters: ["populated"] }, outcome: false}
  ];
  
  cases.forEach((test_case) => {
    test("provides expected outcome", () => {
      expect(checkBookHydration(test_case.state)).toEqual(test_case.outcome);
    });
  });
});

describe("instantiateBook", () => {
  var saga = {};
  saga.gen = cloneableGenerator(instantiateBook)();
  
  test("begins by checking hydration of book nodes/chapters",() => {
    expect(saga.gen.next().value).toMatchObject(select(checkBookHydration));
    saga.dehydrated = { gen: saga.gen.clone() };
    saga.hydrated = saga.gen.clone();
  });
  
  describe("BRANCH dehydration === false ", ()=> {
    test("ends saga",() => {
      expect(saga.hydrated.next(false).done).toEqual(true);
    });
  });
  
  describe("BRANCH dehydration === true", ()=> {
    test("begins /api/nodes && api/chapters requests", ()=> {
      expect(saga.dehydrated.gen.next(true).value).toEqual(
        all([
          call(axios.get,'/api/nodes'),
          call(axios.get,'/api/chapters')
        ])
      );
      
+       saga.dehydrated = {
+         red: saga.dehydrated.gen.clone(),
+         green: saga.dehydrated.gen.clone()
+       };
    });
    
+     describe("BRANCH try/catch === green", () => {
+       test("dispatches loadNodes and loadChapters with returned data", ()=> {
+         let [nodes, chapters] = [
+           {data: [{content: "Test node"}]},
+           {data: [{title: "Test Chapter"}]}
+         ];
+         
+         expect(saga.dehydrated.green.next([nodes, chapters]).value).toEqual(all([
+           put(loadNodes(nodes.data)),
+           put(loadChapters(chapters.data))
+         ]));
+       });
+     });
+     
+     describe("BRANCH try/catch === red", () => {
+       test("dispatches ADD_ALERT with message of failed load", () =>{
+         let red_case = saga.dehydrated.red.next(new Error("awww shiiit."));
+         expect(red_case.value.PUT.action.type).toEqual("ADD_ALERT");
+       });
+     });
+   });
});
```



Note that due to the simplicity of the `watchRoutesToClearAlerts` saga, I have elected not to put it under test.  Right now all the saga does is listen to our routes and dispatches a single static action when a match occurs.  These features are tested in Redux-Saga itself, and I see little value in adding repeat coverage.  If the logic of this saga increases in complexity, we can revisit tests at that time.

## Wrapping Up

This chapter we introduced the concept of High Order Components or HOCs.  Constructed by functions these components tend to be highly reusable and an excellent pattern when we need several components to make similar data connections.
