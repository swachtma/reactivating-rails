# Chapter 9: High Order Components

This chapter we refactor our container to increase their reusability.  To do this, we transform our container for chapters into a High Order Component sharing its connection to our chapters state with several components.

We also establish a new `alerts` state, to build some early error handling in our client.

## Getting Started 

If you're starting here or jumping between chapters, I recommend executing the code below to clone the project and check out the branch for this chapter.

``` bash
# Copy and paste the following commands to check out the starter commit
git clone https://github.com/swachtma/reactivating-rails-app.git && \
cd reactivating-rails-app && \
git checkout ch9-starter
```

## Iteration Plan

A High Order Component is a function which dynamically constructs new React components.  We're are going to be working with this pattern in this chapter to maximize the reusability of our containers, and minimize the ammount of data preperation our components needs to perform.

I have two primary goals in mind for this iteration:
* Evolve container elements so they can be used by several components requiring similar store elements.
* Give our containers full responsibility for managing store data

As we work, we will also make several feature improvements to our applciation.  Adding a footer link to the bottom of each chapter advance to the enxt chapter.  And also creating an alerting framework we can use to deliver messages to our users.  As we design these enhancements we'll redesign our containers to better serve multiple components data from our store.

## High Order Components

High Orders Components (HOCs) are functions which return new React components. They are handy for sharing logic and data connections among several components.  When we have repeatable work we need to share, HOCs allow us to construct or modify other React compoents.  Using HOCs to perform these complex operations leaeves our components free to focus solely on the visual rendering of our content.

## Composing our first High Order Component

Let’s begin by refactoring our chapter’s container.  I am going to rename our file `src/containers/chapter_menu_items.js` to `src/containers/chapters_provider.js` to better reflect its new use; be sure you do the same.

``` javascript(/client/src/containers/chapter_provider.js)
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import React from 'react';

import ChapterMenuItems from '../components/chapter_menu_items';
import { routeChapter } from '../actions/routes';

+ export const connectToChapters = (WrappedComponent) => {
+   return connect(mapStateToProps,mapDispatchToProps)(
+     chapterProvider(WrappedComponent)
+   );
+ };

+ const chapterProvider = (WrappedComponent) => {
+   return class extends React.Component {
+     render(){
+       if(this.props.chapters !== [] && this.props.active_chapter){
+         return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} />;
+         
+       } else {
+         return null;
+       }
+     }
+   };
};

const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
  active_chapter: state.chapters.find(
   (chapter) => chapter.id === state.settings.active_chapter_id
  ),
  chapters: state.chapters
});

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => ({
  dispatchRouteChapter: (event,target) => dispatch(routeChapter(target.value))
});

// EXPORTABLE CONNECTED COMPONENTS
+ export const ConnectedChapterMenuItems = connectToChapters(ChapterMenuItems);
```

Let's start with what's familiar; the `connect` function, which has been updated to call a function `chapterProvider(WrappedComponent)` instead of a component.  We know `connect` expects to recieve a component though, so there's a clue about what `chapterProvider` is doing.

Step inside `chapterProvider`, and you see it immediately calls return.  That return constructs a new React component for us.  You might recognize the code in that new component's render method; it's the test we wrote previously for `chapterMenuItems`, to ensure nothing dependent on the chapters key of our store rendered before the store populated.

Instead of directly dictating what renders, this HOC expects to be passed another component.  Our HOC wraps that passed component with our test for chapter availability; rendering the component if data is available, and otherwise simply returning null.

We use `{...this.props}` to ensure any props in our HOC, get passed to the rendered component.  Passing props is critical, because any store data leverage by this HOC will come from `connect` as props.  The spread operator ensures all props reach the final component we are trying to render.   This also makes our connection to the store highly reusable.  Any component that needs chapter data can be passed through this same HOC.

Now we can make some updates to `ChapterMenuItems` to remove the rendering logic we no longer need.

``` javascript(/client/src/components/chapter_menu_items.js)
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Dropdown } from 'semantic-ui-react';

export default class ChapterMenuItems extends Component {
  renderChapterOptions = () => {
    let chapters_list = [];
    this.props.chapters.forEach((chapter) => {
      chapters_list.push(
        { 
          key: "chapter_" + chapter.id,
          id:  "chapter_menu_item_" + chapter.id,
          value: chapter.id,
          text: chapter.title,
          active: chapter.id === this.props.active_chapter.id
        }
      );
    });
    return chapters_list;
  }
  
  render() {
    return( 
        <Dropdown 
          tabIndex="1"
          placeholder="Jump to Chapter..."
          className="link item"
          selectOnNavigation={false}
          value={this.props.active_chapter.id}
          text={this.props.active_chapter.title}
          onChange={this.props.dispatchRouteChapter}
          options={this.renderChapterOptions()} 
        />
      );
  }
}
```

We also need to update `MenuBar` to use our new `ConnectedChapterMenuItems` component.

``` javascript(/client/src/components/menu_bar.js)
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Container, Image, Menu } from 'semantic-ui-react';
import reactLogo from '../assets/images/react-logo.svg';
import railsLogo from '../assets/images/rails-logo.svg';

+ import { ConnectedChapterMenuItems } from '../containers/chapter_provider';

const fixedMenuStyle = {
  backgroundColor: '#fff',
  border: '1px solid #ddd',
  boxShadow: '0px 3px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)',
  paddingTop: "13px",
  paddingBottom: "13px"
};

const tightItem = {
  paddingTop: "0",
  paddingBottom: "0"
}

class MenuBar extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
        <Menu
          id="menu_bar"
          borderless
          stackable
          fixed="top"
          style={ fixedMenuStyle }
        >
          <Container textAlign="center">
            <Menu.Item className="banner" style={tightItem}>
              <Image size='mini' src={reactLogo} />
              <Image size='mini' src={railsLogo} />
              <Menu.Item header>Reactivating Rails: A work in progress</Menu.Item>
            </Menu.Item>

            <Menu.Menu position='right' style={tightItem} value={this.props.active_chapter}>
+               <ConnectedChapterMenuItems />
            </Menu.Menu>
          </Container>
        </Menu>
    );
  }
}

export default MenuBar;
```

## Reusability of High Order Components

Let's build a footer chapter link to demonstrate the reusability of our HOC.  First though, to create a link using Redux First Router we need to install a module: `docker-compose exec client yarn add redux-first-router-link`.

Now let's create the Component in a new file `src/components/chapter_footer.js`

``` javascript(/client/src/components/chapter_footer.js)
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import Link from 'redux-first-router-link';

import * as routes from '../constants/settings.js';

const chapter_footer_style = {
  margin: "15px 0",
  textAlign: "center",
};

class ChapterFooter extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div id="chapter-footer-link" style={chapter_footer_style}>
        <h2>
          <Link to={{
            type: routes.CHAPTER_ROUTE,
            payload: {chapter_id: this.props.active_chapter.id + 1}
          }}>
            Next Chapter
          </Link>
        </h2>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default ChapterFooter;
```

`Link` from Redux First Router allows us to use several formats to construct link paths.  We can provide a route such as `chapter/6`, or an action as seen above.  I prefer using actions, because if paths change we can update our action creators and avoid needing to change links in a slew of places.

Next we need to connect this component to our provider.

``` javascript(/client/src/containers/chapter_provider.js)
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import React from 'react';

import ChapterMenuItems from '../components/chapter_menu_items';
+ import ChapterFooter from '../components/chapter_footer';
import { routeChapter } from '../actions/routes';

export const connectToChapters = (WrappedComponent) => {
  return connect(mapStateToProps,mapDispatchToProps)(
    chapterProvider(WrappedComponent)
  );
};

const chapterProvider = (WrappedComponent) => {
  return class extends React.Component {
    render(){
      if(this.props.chapters !== [] && this.props.active_chapter){
        return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} />;
        
      } else {
        return null;
      }
    }
  };
};

const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
  active_chapter: state.chapters.find(
   (chapter) => chapter.id === state.settings.active_chapter_id
  ),
  chapters: state.chapters
});

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => ({
  dispatchRouteChapter: (event,target) => dispatch(routeChapter(target.value))
});

// EXPORTABLE CONNECTED COMPONENTS
export const ConnectedChapterMenuItems = connectToChapters(ChapterMenuItems);
+ export const ConnectedChapterFooterLink = connectToChapters(ChapterFooter);
```

Now we can use this new exportable inside `ReaderPane`.

> **Note:** I am also updating our styles on this component a bit.)

``` javascript(/client/src/components/reader_pane.js)
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Container } from 'semantic-ui-react';
+ import { ConnectedChapterFooterLink } from '../containers/chapter_provider';

+ const reader_pane_styles= {
+   paddingBottom: "15px"
+ };

class ReaderPane extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div id="reader-pane" style={ reader_pane_styles }>
        <Container text>
        { this.props.children }
+         <ConnectedChapterFooterLink />
        </Container>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default ReaderPane;
```

Let's go ahead and take a look at this first simple pass.

![Simple Footer Link](/images/9/SimpleFooterLink.png)


## Extensibility of High Order Components

Our footer link is passable for a first attempt.  It would be better to use the title of the next chapter as link text, rather than a simple "Next" message.  Also, when we reach the end of the book, we shouldn't advertise a link for a next chapter that doesn't exist.

``` javascript(/client/src/containers/chapter_provider.js)
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import React from 'react';

import ChapterMenuItems from '../components/chapter_menu_items';
import ChapterFooter from '../components/chapter_footer';
import { routeChapter } from '../actions/routes';

export const connectToChapters = (WrappedComponent) => {
  return connect(mapStateToProps,mapDispatchToProps)(
    chapterProvider(WrappedComponent)
  );
};

const chapterProvider = (WrappedComponent) => {
  return class extends React.Component {
    render(){
      if(this.props.chapters !== [] && this.props.active_chapter){
        return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} />;
        
      } else {
        return null;
      }
    }
  };
};

const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
  active_chapter: state.chapters.find(
   (chapter) => chapter.id === state.settings.active_chapter_id
  ),
  
+   next_chapter: state.chapters.find(
+   (chapter) => chapter.id === state.settings.active_chapter_id + 1
+   ),
  
  chapters: state.chapters
});

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => ({
  dispatchRouteChapter: (event,target) => dispatch(routeChapter(target.value))
});

// EXPORTABLE CONNECTED COMPONENTS
export const ConnectedChapterMenuItems = connectToChapters(ChapterMenuItems);
export const ConnectedChapterFooterLink = connectToChapters(ChapterFooter);
```

We are upgrading `next_chapter` as we did `active_chapter`;  passing a complete chapter object, rather than a simple ID.  Now let's update our ChapterFooter component to make use of this new prop.

``` javascript(/client/src/components/chapter_footer.js)
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import Link from 'redux-first-router-link';

import * as actions from '../actions/routes.js';

const chapter_footer_style = {
  margin: "30px 0",
  textAlign: "center",
};

class ChapterFooter extends Component {
  
+   renderLinkOrThanks = (next_chapter) => {
+     let thanks = "The End - Thank you for Reading!";
+     return next_chapter ? 
+       <Link to={actions.routeChapter(next_chapter.id)}>
+         Next - {next_chapter.title}
+       </Link> : thanks;
+   }
  
  render() {
    return (
      <div id="chapter-footer-link" style={chapter_footer_style}>
        <h2>
+           { this.renderLinkOrThanks(this.props.next_chapter) }
        </h2>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default ChapterFooter;
```

We are now using our action creator function for our routes inside the `Link` component. 

We also added a new method, `renderLinkOrThanks`.  This method checks whether a `next_chapter` prop exists, and either prints our `Link`, or a thank you message for readers.  (Because I do appreciate you choosing to read this, and I hope the text serves you well).

We could have made this data selection for `next_chapter` inside of our footer component to the same result.  However, I often think of containers as I do ActiveRecord models; you could perform your data operations in a view, but you probably shouldn’t.

## Handling Errors and Messaging in our Client

We haven't done much error reporting so far, becasue frankly, we haven't needed it.  Right now, the only thing I can see going wrong is a failure to instantiate our book.  If instantiation suceeds, the rest of our application should be nearly bulletproof.

As we expand functionality, the need to report messages to our users and informing them of state changes, and problems increases.  I want to prepare for this messaging now so we have it available future iterations.

Thinking about what I need from this system, this is what I come up with:
* Not all alerts are negative; I would like the system to support positive, neutral, and error messages.
* Alerts should be contextual for the area of the application that triggered them.
* Alerts should clear on a route change.

I am going to define my action creator first in `src/actions/alerts.js`.

``` javascript(/client/src/actions/alerts.js)
import * as constants from "../constants/alerts";

export const addAlert = (message, level = constants.lvls[0], scope = constants.scopes[0]) => ({
  type: constants.ADD_ALERT, payload: {message, level, scope, timestamp: Date.now()}
});

export const clearAlerts = () => ({ type: constants.CLEAR_ALERTS }) ;
```

`addAlert` uses function default parameters to assign a values to `scope` and `level`.  `Date.now()` creates a timestamp for each alert.  The timestamp can serve as our unique key for printing alerts as a collection in React. since we lack and Active Record ID for this element.  It also allows us to order alerts chronologically if needed.

I am also defining a constants file for our action creators and reducer.
 
``` javascript(/client/src/constants/alerts.js)
export const ADD_ALERT = "ADD_ALERT";
export const CLEAR_ALERTS = "CLEAR_ALERTS";

// Enumerated Values, default array[0] in reducer & actionCreators
export const scopes = ["application"];
export const lvls = ["info","warning","success","danger"];
```

We also need a reducer for our store.  

``` javascript(/client/src/reducers/alerts.js)
import * as constants from '../constants/alerts';
const default_state = [];

export const normalizeAlert = (payload) => {
  payload.scope = constants.scopes.includes(payload.scope) ? 
    payload.scope : constants.scopes[0];
  payload.level = constants.lvls.includes(payload.level) ?
    payload.level : constants.lvls[0];
  
  return payload;
};

const alertsReducer = function(state = default_state,action){
  switch (action.type) {
    case(constants.ADD_ALERT):
+       return [...state, normalizeAlert(action.payload)]
    case(constants.CLEAR_ALERTS):
      return [];
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

export default alertsReducer;
```

We haven't seen a return like; `return [...state, normalizeAlert(action.payload)]` in our previous reducers.  This syntax is one of the easiest ways to append new items to an array in our state.  Using the literal syntax, combined with the spread operator we carry over the existing state, and append the new values simultanesouly.

The second case of our reducer's switch statement (`CLEAR_ALERTS`) resets our store to an empty Array.

Don't forget to add this reducer to your `combineReducers` function inside of `store.js` before moving forward.

### Leveraging our Alerts Reducer

I need to modify a few of my existing scripts to leverage this new alert structure for error reporting.  Let's start with our instantiate book saga.

``` javascript(/client/src/sagas/instantiate_book.js)
import { takeEvery, select, put, call, all } from 'redux-saga/effects';
import axios from 'axios';

import * as routes from '../constants/settings';
import { loadNodes } from '../actions/nodes';
import { loadChapters } from '../actions/chapters';
+ import { addAlert } from '../actions/alerts';

export const checkBookHydration = (state) => {
    return !(state.chapters.length && state.nodes.length)
  }

export function* instantiateBook(){
  const dehydrated = yield select(checkBookHydration);
  
  if(dehydrated){
-     try{
-       const [nodes, chapters] = yield all([
-         call(axios.get,'/api/nodes'),
-         call(axios.get,'/api/chapters')
-       ]);
-       
-       yield all([
-         put(loadNodes(nodes.data)),
-         put(loadChapters(chapters.data))
-       ]);
-     }
+     catch(e){
+       yield put(addAlert(
+         "We were unable to fetch the latest copy of this book at this time. " +
+         "Sorry for the inconvenience!  You can try refreshing your browser. " +
+         "Or returning to visit another time.",
+         "danger"
+       ));
+     }
  }
} 

window.instantiateBook = instantiateBook;

export function* watchBookRoutesSaga(){
  yield takeEvery([routes.HOME_ROUTE, routes.CHAPTER_ROUTE], instantiateBook);
};
```

We are manually adding an alert to the catch block of our saga.  We could also return error values from our API use those messages within our alerts if we needed more detailed messaging.

Temporarily set your fetch of nodes to `call(axios.get,'/api/node')` instead of the correct `call(axios.get,'/api/nodes')`.  If we allow the application to load now, we can see our saga dispatch the alert message in our dev tools.

### Creating an Alerts HOC

Now let's set up our container.

``` javascript(/client/src/containers/alert_provider.js)
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import React from 'react';

import { scopes } from '../constants/alerts';
import AlertList from '../components/alert_list';

const alertProvider = (scope = scopes[0], WrappedComponent = AlertList) => {
  let mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
    alerts: state.alerts.filter((a) => a.scope === scope)
  });
  
  return connect(mapStateToProps,null)(WrappedComponent);
};

export default alertProvider;
```

We are taking a different approach with this HOC, this time letting `connect` build our intermediary component.  However, we can still use a wrapping function to increase the flexibility of the exported module.

We are passing in two parameters to our function.  The first, `scope` we supply with a default value from our constants file.  If we don't specify a scope, our HOC defaults to "application".  If we want to use this container in other more focused areas of our application, we might pass "login", or another value to limit which alerts display.  

The scope value is utilized in `mapStateToProps` to ensure the wrapped component only recieves alerts with a matching scope.

We are also passing a `WrappedComponent` property, which defaults to an `AlertList` component.  We can override this component if we need to, but the default allows us to omit the parameter otherwise when we call this function.  This approach gives us flexibility to reuse this connection to our alert state.  That flexibility encourages us to standardize how we handle messages across our whole application.

### Printing Alerts

Let's go ahead and define the `AlertList` component.

``` javascript(/client/src/components/alert_list.js)
import React, { Component } from 'react';

const alertStyle = {
  padding: "15px",
  marginBottom: "20px",
  border: "1px solid transparent",
  borderRadius: "4px"
},

alertLevels = {
  info: {
    backgroundColor: "#d9edf7",
    borderColor: "#bce8f1",
    color: "#31708f"
  },
  warning: {
    backgroundColor: "#fcf8e3",
    borderColor: "#faebcc",
    color: "#8a6d3b"
  },
  success:{
    backgroundColor: "#dff0d8",
    borderColor: "#d6e9c6",
    color: "#3c763d"
  },
  danger: {
    backgroundColor: "#f2dede",
    borderColor: "#ebccd1",
    color: "#a94442"
  }
};

class AlertList extends Component {
  renderAlertMessages = (alerts) => {
    return alerts.map((a) => 
      <div 
        key={a.timestamp}
        className={"alert alert-" + a.level }
        style={Object.assign(alertStyle,alertLevels[a.level])}
        children={a.message}
      />
    );
  }
  
  render() {
    return (
      <div className={"alert_list_" + this.props.scope}>
        { this.renderAlertMessages(this.props.alerts) }
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default AlertList;
```

We are borrowing some styles from Bootstrap CSS to produce bootstrap-like alert boxes.  

I have implemented styles in our JavaScript for this component.  We have defined a base style constant with the common attributes shared by all four alert levels.  Then I have set up a nested object with the unique styles for each of the variations (info, warning, danger, success).

When our component builds each message, it uses Object.assign to merge the base style, and the specific style for each alert level into a single object for styling each alert.

The last thing we need to take care of for this process is updating our application layout in `src/App.js`.

``` javascript(/client/src/App.js)
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import './App.css'

import ReaderPane from './components/reader_pane';
import MenuBar from './components/menu_bar';
import FilteredNodesList from './containers/filtered_nodes_list';
+ import connectToAlerts from './containers/alert_provider';
+ let ApplicationAlerts = connectToAlerts();

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div id="app">
        <MenuBar />
        <ReaderPane>
+           <ApplicationAlerts />
          <FilteredNodesList />
        </ReaderPane>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

Note wee assign the return value of `connectToAlerts` to a variable, using it as a component name inside our JSX.  You could also invoke your function inside the App component's render method: `{ connectToAlerts() }`.  The net result would be the same.  However, I like my JSX to be as uninterrupted as possible, so I prefer insolating function calls as above.

With our intentionally broken routes still in place inside our `instantiateBook` saga, let's see what we have to show for our efforts.

![Application level alert message](/images/9/ApplicationAlert.png)

### Clearing Alerts with a Simple Saga

Before we wrap, we should introduce a mechanism to clear alerts.  That way they don't pile up once we have more areas of our application pushing out messages.

Clearing alerts on a route change seems like a wise place to start.  If we outgrow that solution in the future, we can always revisit it.

Create a new saga at `src/sagas/clear_alerts.js`.

``` javascript(/client/src/sagas/clear_alerts.js)
import { takeEvery, put } from 'redux-saga/effects';

import * as routes from '../constants/settings';
import { clearAlerts } from '../actions/alerts';

export function* watchRoutesToClearAlerts(){
+   yield takeEvery(Object.keys(routes), () => put(clearAlerts()));
}
```

We are doing is using `Object.keys` to link this saga to all of our route action types.  

Sijnce our "saga" only need to do one thing, we can forgoe writting a full blown generator function.  Instead, we pass an anonymous function returning the put effect, and calling our `clearAlerts` action creator.  

Don't forget to add this new saga to your root saga before testing!

``` javascript(/client/src/sagas/root.js)
import { all } from 'redux-saga/effects';
import { watchBookRoutesSaga } from './instantiate_book';
+ import { watchRoutesToClearAlerts } from './clear_alerts';

export default function* rootSaga(){
  yield all([
    watchBookRoutesSaga(),
+     watchRoutesToClearAlerts()
  ]);
}
```

To test this new saga, try loading a chapter route, and then running `store.dispatch({type: "HOME_ROUTE"})` in your browser console.  You should see the alert flash as it clears from our state, only to be added again when the route fails to load.  You can also check your work in the action history of ReduxDevTools by ensuring `CLEAR_ALERTS` dispatches as you would expect after each route change.

When you are satisfied everything is working, restore the proper routes in your `instantiateBook` saga to put things back in working order.
 
## Closing out with Tests

The tests I have for this chapter leverage the same strategies we have used in previously, so we aren't going through them in detail.  They are included here though for context if you would like to review them, or copy them into your application.

``` javascript(/client/src/actions/alerts.spec.js)
/* global expect */
import * as actions from './alerts';

We should also add a red case branch for our `instantiateBook` saga's try/catch logic.

``` javascript(/client/src/sagas/instantiate_book.spec.js)
/* global expect */
import { instantiateBook, checkBookHydration } from './instantiate_book';
import { cloneableGenerator } from 'redux-saga/utils';
import { select, all, call, put } from 'redux-saga/effects';
import axios from 'axios';

import { loadNodes } from '../actions/nodes';
import { loadChapters } from '../actions/chapters';
+ import { addAlert } from '../actions/alerts';

describe("checkBookHydration", ()=> {
  const cases = [
    {state: {nodes: [], chapters: [] }, outcome: true},
    {state: {nodes: ["populated"], chapters: [] }, outcome: true},
    {state: {nodes: [], chapters: ["populated"] }, outcome: true},
    {state: {nodes: ["populated"], chapters: ["populated"] }, outcome: false}
  ];
  
  cases.forEach((test_case) => {
    test("provides expected outcome", () => {
      expect(checkBookHydration(test_case.state)).toEqual(test_case.outcome);
    });
  });
});

describe("instantiateBook", () => {
  var saga = {};
  saga.gen = cloneableGenerator(instantiateBook)();
  
  test("begins by checking hydration of book nodes/chapters",() => {
    expect(saga.gen.next().value).toMatchObject(select(checkBookHydration));
    saga.dehydrated = { gen: saga.gen.clone() };
    saga.hydrated = saga.gen.clone();
  });
  
  describe("BRANCH dehydration === false ", ()=> {
    test("ends saga",() => {
      expect(saga.hydrated.next(false).done).toEqual(true);
    });
  });
  
  describe("BRANCH dehydration === true", ()=> {
    test("begins /api/nodes && api/chapters requests", ()=> {
      expect(saga.dehydrated.gen.next(true).value).toEqual(
        all([
          call(axios.get,'/api/nodes'),
          call(axios.get,'/api/chapters')
        ])
      );
      
+       saga.dehydrated = {
+         red: saga.dehydrated.gen.clone(),
+         green: saga.dehydrated.gen.clone()

    });
    
+     describe("BRANCH try/catch === green", () => {

+           put(loadChapters(chapters.data))

+   });
});
```

Due to the simplicity of the `watchRoutesToClearAlerts` saga, I have elected not to put it under test.  Right now, all the saga does is listen to our routes and dispatches a single static action when a match occurs.  These features are tested in Redux-Saga itself, and I see little value in adding repeat coverage.  If the logic of this saga increases in complexity, we can revisit tests at that time.

## Wrapping Up

This chapter we introduced the concept of High Order Components or HOCs.  Constructed by functions these components tend to be highly reusable and an excellent pattern when we need several components to make similar data connections.
