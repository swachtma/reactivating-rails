# Chapter 4: The Client Store

Now that our API is helpfully spitting back JSON primed for use in our FSAs, it's time we upgrade our client to digest this information.  In this chapter we'll be setting up Redux to manage our client side store, and preparing for all of the client side state we'll need to manage in our application.

## Client Side Data Structure 

We need to spend some time planning our client side data structure.  This is going to have a big influence on the way we populate and access our application state.  There are two approaches we commonly see in store design: deep structures vs. wide structures.

Deep structures tend to use nesting of related elements to create their organization.  An example for our purposes might look like the following:

``` javascript
{
  content: [{chapter_id, title, nodes: [{node_id, markdown},{...}]}]
}
```

Here we see our two data types represented, and at the simplest level, we have our chapters which are grouped into an array of objects.  We could order these elements inside our store to allow us to easily pull and print our chapters.  Our nodes are a little more complex.  We've nested the nodes for each chapter inside an object structure of their parent element (in this case chapters).  The advantage of this approach is most likely speed of access; if we want to pull all the nodes related to a specific chapter we can do so easily off that chapter relation.

The tradeoff, is the complexity of populating this structure.  The drawback is harder to see with our simplified data model.  But imagine this structure applied to our full data layout:

```
{
  content: [{chapter_id, title, sections: [
    { section_id, title, nodes: [
      { node_id, content }]
    }] 
  }]
}
```

You begin to see why this creates complexity when we need to load or update data.  If we need to update the nodes for a specific chapter/section we would need to traverse the entire tree structure, find the content we need and then make our updates.  And to make that just a little more interesting Redux will want us to return a **new** objected, not an updated copy of the old object reference.  

I'll admit this is largely a matter of preference; but my preference is strongly for wide and flat Redux stores.

In our case this will look more like the following:

``` javascript
{
  chapters: [{id, title}, {...}]  
  sections: [{id, section_id, heading}, {...}]
  nodes: [{id, chapter_id, section_id, content},{...}]
}
```

This means when we load new nodes, we can likely ignore the `chapters` and `sections` part of our store entirely.  Our reducers can enforce business rules that are relevant to each part of the store.  And we have a way to easily and flexibly load only parts of our store content.  

For the moment, as we did with our API we are going to set aside the concept of sections entirely.  So our store plan will look like the following:

``` javascript
{
  chapters: [{id, title}, {...}]  
  nodes: [{id, chapter_id, content},{...}]
}
```

We're going to use our active Record ID's to dictate content order.  This will rely on our API to load content according to that schema (so far so good).  We're also going to ensure our store's reducers **enforce** this rule.  When content is loaded, we'll ensure the array of chapters, or nodes, is sorted according to the ID schema.  So chapter.id == 1 will be positioned in front of chapter.id == 2.

Our lower level elements will enforce a multi-level sort, first sorting by the chapter_id value, and then the node's own id value afterwards.  

The reason for this policy is that it allows our React components to be stupid about such logic.  Would you rather sort and order your store on the fly every time you read content?  Or we can enforce content rules in a central location, and know our components can just pick a starting point in the document and print content in the order it's handed to them?  I know my vote.

## Installing Redux

We need to do a little setup before we can dive into our client work.

We're going to install Redux, as well as react-redux, which is the official store connector for usage with React.
```
npm install --save redux
npm install --save react-redux
```

We're going to need to setup our store, and a provide it to our React components before we can start working on developing our data structure.

For a start, let's look at providing our store to our application.  Create a new directory `src/reducers` inside your client folder structure.  And inside that directory, create a file `store.js`.  This will be the entry point into our Redux store logic; here's we'll assemble our reducers into a single Root reducer function, apply middleware, set defaults for our application state and other tasks. For now though, we're going to start small.

``` javascript
import { createStore } from "redux";

const store = createStore((state,action) => state);

export default store;
```

We're using the `createStore` method provided to us by Redux to instantiate a new store.  You'll notice inside we're providing a function as a parameter for the store: `createStore((state,action) => state);`.  That function is for the moment serving as our reducer.  A reducer, if you are not already familiar, is a function that at its simplest takes two arguments; the current state of our store, and an action.  And it returns a **new** state object.  We're going to revisit this concept in a moment, once we've wired in our store to our React components.

Open `src/index.js` and modify it as follows:

``` javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import store from './reducers/store';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';
import registerServiceWorker from './registerServiceWorker';

window.store = store;

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
      <App />
  </Provider>
  ,document.getElementById('root')
);
    
registerServiceWorker();
```

We are wrapping our top level `App` component inside the Higher Order Component `Provider`, given to us by react-redux.  Provider will make our `store` available to each of our components.  The documentation for Redux explains that you could accomplish a similar pattern by passing the store manually through your component properties, such as `<App store={store} />`.  However, this would quickly become tedious, as we'll have many components in our hierarchy that have no direct need of the store, however they would still be responsible for passing the store through the properties of any child components they might render.  Provider, takes care of this for us somewhat automagically.

You'll notice I've also assigned our store to the Browser's `window` object.  This will make our store available to us in the Browser console, a step which I find very useful for testing purposes.

Now let's talk about reducers.  We said above that a reducer is a function that takes a state, and an action, and returns a new state.  Before we look at that, we should probably quickly discuss what an action, is.  Redux is built on the Flux pattern, and therefore we'll be using Flux Standard Actions, or FSAs.  For brevity’s sake, most people simply refer to them as actions.  But an action you might remember from last chapter, is simply an object, which follows the pattern `{type: "SOME_KEY", some_data: "stuff"}`.  The type parameter is a unique name for the action inside of our application, and tells our reducers whether or not they need to operate on a dispatched action.

When we dispatch an action to our store, such as: `store.dispatch({type: "SOME_KEY", some_data: "stuff"})` the action gets passed to our reducer function, which will check the value of `type`, and respond as needed.  While it's possible to house all of our reducer logic in a single reducer function, the more common approach is to use a nested reducer structure, where one reducer operates at the top level, and defers ownership of smaller areas of the states to nested reducer functions. In this way, we are able to create a separation of concerns with our application logic.  In our case this means we'll end up with dedicated reducers for our node state, our chapter state, perhaps our sections, and maybe an area of user content... who knows.

When an action is dispatched, it is passed to ALL of our nested reducers, and the `type` attribute dictates which reducers respond, and how.

The action should also contain everything else in the payload (other attributes) that the reducer will need to accomplish the given action's intended mutation of the state. Our reducers will contain logic within them that reads the current state from our store, and then using the action payload, returns a **new** object for our application state.  Or if the action type is not relevant for that particular reducer, then the reducer will simply return the current unaltered state.

Let's add an action to our Reducer.

``` javascript
import { createStore } from "redux";

let default_state = {nodes: []};

const store = createStore(
  function(state = default_state,action){
    switch (action.type) {
      case("LOAD_NODES"):
        return Object.assign({},state,
        { nodes: action.payload}
        );
      default:
        return state;
    }
  }
);

export default store;
```

Now our reducer has instructions on how to handle a new action type: "LOAD_NODES".  When this action is passed, we will use `Object.assign` to build a new state object.  The assign method will merge several objects into a new object; note that we pass an object literal as the first parameter to ensure we end this process with a **new** and not updated state object.  This is critical for React/Redux to correctly identify when the state has been updated, and where.  Assign will then merge keys for the trailing objects passed as parameters, giving preference to the later members to of the attribute list when keys overlap.  

In our usage, this gives us an easy way to overwrite all the stored nodes with a new array.

You'll also notice our function definition has changed to assign a default state by setting a default value for the state parameter of our store. This is one of the ways Redux gives us to instantiate our store with a default state.

Open up your Browser, and load your application.  Let's run some commands in the console.

```javascript
store.getState();
store.dispatch({type: "LOAD_NODES", payload: [{id: 1, chapter_id: 1, content: "# Some Heading"}]})
store.getState();
store.dispatch({type: "SOME_ACTION", payload: "Somes stuff"})
store.getState();
```
This example is why I like to make the store available on the Browser's window.  When we add new actions, we can easily validate our reducer actions by doing some simple dispatch actions to our store.

Notice, on the first call to `store.getState()` that we see our default returned, including an empty array of nodes.  Then our first dispatched action, loads in an example node, and our state is updated to reflect this new array.  Then another action is dispatched; but the state comes back to us unaltered because it's not a type our reducers currently manage.  

That is the simplest representation I can give you of the reducer pattern; we operate on what we understand and own, and ignore what we do not.

## Combine Reducers 

Our life would get unwieldy fast if we needed to manage all of our state from a single reducer for an application of any size.  Redux though, helpfully provides us with a way to split out concerns for our state using a helper function `combineReducers()`.

Let's make some modifications to our Reducer setup, by splitting off our nodes reducers as its own function.  Create a new file `reducers/nodes`.

``` javascript
let default_state = [];

const nodesReducer = function(state = default_state,action){
  switch (action.type) {
    case("LOAD_NODES"):
      return [...action.payload];
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

export default nodesReducer;
```

This is almost a straight migration of the reducer function we wrote a moment ago, with a few small modifications. Look first at our new default state variable, now set to a simple Array literal, rather than our previous `{nodes: []}`.  This gives us a clue as to what is happening.  Rather than managing the entire state tree, we are setting up this reducer to own just one concern, in this case the array of nodes in our book.  As such that is the **only** slice of the state this reducer can manage.

As a result, our action `LOAD_NODES`, has been updated so we are no longer returning an object, but rather an Array of our nodes.  Notice that one thing hasn't changed, we're still returning new state objects, rather than updating the state.  We can do this quite easily using the Array literal syntax, and spread operator to setup a new array with all the nodes from our action payload.  

Just as we saw before, if our reducer doesn't know how to handle an action type, it will simply return an unaltered copy of the state (in this case the existing array of nodes.)

Now let's update our `store.js` file to use this new reducer.

``` javascript
import { createStore, combineReducers } from "redux";
import nodes from './nodes';

const store = createStore(
  combineReducers({nodes})
);

export default store;
```

First, we're going to import our new `nodesReducer()` function as a module under the name `nodes`.  Then update the create store method to use the combineReducers helper function, and pass it an Object whose keys include our imported reducer.

Let's revisit the browser console and look at our default state.

``` javascript
JSON.stringify(store.getState())
"{"nodes":[]}"
```

Back where we started... except now our nodes reducer can painlessly operate on the `nodes` array in our state, without needing to be aware of the rest of our state tree.  

Where did the `nodes` key name come from in our state tree though?  That is a small gift of ES2015's object destructing syntax.  When we passed `combineReducers` an object with our imported `nodes` reducer, we didn't explicitly assign a key name for the object's attribute, so it is assumed that the variable we passed contains the value we want to assign, and that its name will be usable as a key.  We could have passed `combineReducers({nodes: nodes})` to the same result.

## Domain Specific Reducer Logic

One of my favorite things about this pattern with reducers is that it defines for us very clear opperating areas for managing each part of our application state.  We said at the start of this chapter that we want to enforce our content order in our reducers to simplify the ability of our components to make use of our book contents.

Now that our nodes state is managed by it's own reducer, we can easily expand our reducer logic to include a sort check on appropriate actions.

``` javascript
import * as constants from '../constants/nodes';

let default_state = [];

export const sortNodes = (nodes) => {
  return nodes.sort((a,b) =>{
    if(a.chapter_id === b.chapter_id){
      return a.id - b.id;
    } else
    {
      return a.chapter_id - b.chapter_id;
    }
  });
};

const nodesReducer = function(state = default_state,action){
  switch (action.type) {
    case(constants.LOAD_NODES):
      return [...sortNodes(action.payload)];
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

export default nodesReducer;
```

We've now defined a new function `sortNodes`, which will order our nodes array before updating the store.  This function will first ensure all chapter id's are ordered correctly, before then doing a secondary sort on the node id.  That sorted array gets returned, where we then continue to use the array literal syntax, and spread opperator to populate our store with a new array instance.

## Structuring our Client Project

Now that we have our store and reducer in place, we should look at setting up a structure for other common assets of our application that will power our Redux store.  Personally, I favor the use of constants, and action creator functions when working with my store.

### Constants Over Strings

The constants are the easier of these two to tackle, so we'll start there by setting up a new folder and file `src/actions/nodes.js`.  Inside it place the following:

```javascript
export const LOAD_NODES = "LOAD_NODES";
```

Our constants file serves a few purposes.  First off, it will act as a data dictionary for our actions and give us a quick place we can look for all the accepted action types taken by our store or application in one place.  This might seem trivial with our measly one action, but it can be a big help as the number of actions begins to grow.

It also serves to give us a defined list of accepted types for our store.  An FSA can accept **any** value in the type attribute of our actions.  And since our store will just happily return the current state anytime it doesn't have a defined response for the action's type, it will fail rather silently if we pass it "LOAD_NODE", when we mean to pass "LOAD_NODES".  Setting up our reducers to use a defined list of constants will give us a limited list of keys to draw from.  If you’re using an IDE that helps you complete variable names, all the better.

Let's update our reducer to use this constants file.

``` javascript
import * as constants from '../constants/nodes';

let default_state = [];

const nodesReducer = function(state = default_state,action){
  switch (action.type) {
    case(constants.LOAD_NODES):
      return [...action.payload];
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

export default nodesReducer;
```

Note the `import * as ...` module import at the top of the file.  You might not be familiar with this ES2015 module syntax yet, but it is going to be a big help to us.  The `* as ...` pattern will import all the exportable items from the referenced file under a namespace given in the directive.  In our case, all our constants will come back to us under the namespace "constants" and be accessible as chained properties.  This lets us write nice readable code in our case statements `case(constants.LOAD_NODES)`.

### Action creators

Now let's turn to our action creators.  As the name implies, action creators create actions.  Since we'll be using our FSAs a lot, it helps us to have these stored in a central location, and to have a function that creates the FSA for us with minimal fuss.  If in the future the structure of our action, or it's payload needs to change, we can update the action creator function rather that to have to chase down every single use of that action type scattered throughout our application.

Create a file and folder path `src/actions/nodes.js` and setup the following.

```javascript
import * as constants from '../constants/nodes';

export const loadNodes = (payload) => ({type: constants.LOAD_NODES, payload});
```

Notice that we use the same import strategy for our constants here that we did for our reducer.  Then we define a new exportable, a function `loadNodes` which will take a payload of information and return an FSA for us.  We're also using an ES2015 shortcut in our function ({}) which implies we wish to return an object literal.  We're then further simplifying the syntax by using the object attribute naming shorthand we mentioned earlier.  Since we aren't defining a property name for the `payload` variable we assign into the object, it's assumed we want the name of that attribute to match our variable name in this case `payload`.

The more verbose approach to this function would have been.

```javascript
export const loadNodes = (payload) => {
  return {type: constants.LOAD_NODES, payload: payload}
}
```

Either way the resulting FSA returned to us takes the form needed for our reducer.


## Bringing it All Together

Now we're ready to update our `App` component to make use of our Redux store, rather than maintaining its own state object.

We're going to do that with the help of the `react-redux` package we installed at the start of this chapter.  And more specifically, the `connect` method it provides.  Put simply connect will help us tie our components properties to our Redux store state, as well as provide a way for us to dispatch actions to our Redux store.  Let's look at the `connect` function a bit before we get started.

`connect` exist to give you a mechanism for mapping the state of your Redux store into the properties of your components.  The connect function itself though has a somewhat usual syntax:

``` javascript
connect(mapStateToProps, actionCreators)(Component)
```

Notice the double parentheses on this function evocation.  This is done because the `connect` function will itself return a function, which is then immediately invoked with a component as it’s argument.  That returned function then constructs a new component, whose properties will be a merge of the items from your store you've connected to the component, and that components own properties.  

Let's take a look at it in action by modifying our App Component.

``` javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import {loadNodes } from './actions/nodes';
import axios from 'axios';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';

const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
  book_body: state.nodes
});

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => ({
  dispatchLoadNodes: (payload) => dispatch(loadNodes(payload))
});

class App extends Component {
  componentWillMount(){
    axios.get("/api/nodes")
    .then(
      (response) => {
        this.props.dispatchLoadNodes(response.data);
      }
    )
    .catch(
      (error) => {
        console.log(error);
      }
    );
  }
  
  renderContentBlocks = (content) => {
    let content_blocks = [];
    content.forEach((block) => {content_blocks.push(<p key={content_blocks.length}>{block.content}</p>)});
    return content_blocks;
  }
  
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <div className="App-header">
          <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
          <h2>Reactivating Rails: A work in progress</h2>
        </div>
        <div className="App-intro">
          { this.renderContentBlocks(this.props.book_body) }
        </div>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default connect(
  mapStateToProps,
  mapDispatchToProps
)(App);
```

We begin by defining two functions `mapStateToProps` and `mapDispatchToProps`.  As their names state, these functions will map elements of our store state to the wrapped components properties.  `mapStateToProps` will be passed a reference to our store, enabling us to select elements from our state (in this case `nodes`), and map them to the properties of our components.

Similarly, `mapDispatchToProps` is passed a reference to our `store.dispatch` function, and can be used to bind our action creator functions to a components properties.  This gives them an easy way to dispatch actions when modifications to the state are needed.  Here we'll be using our `loadNodes` action creator to populate our nodes in the store when our API request completes, rather than directly modifying the components state using `setState` as we have previously.

I tend to name my dispatch functions `dispatchActionCreator` to make it clear which bound properties of my components are trigger dispatches of actions to the store.  So in this case, we've defined `dispatchLoadNodes` as a function, which will take a single argument (our nodes array).  When invoked, our action creator will produce a complete FSA, and dispatch the action to our store.

Notice that the references to `this.state` have changed to `this.props` in the components other methods.

Finally, we call connect, and pass with our two mapping functions, and the App component itself.  This invocation becomes the new default exportable for our file, and references to `App` in other files such as `index.js` now received this connected component.  

This is an admittedly shallow look at what connect does.  When you’re comfortable with its basic uses, I strongly recommend a deeper investigation into this library.  There's an impressive amount of logic built into the way connect manages binding components to your store state to ensure that connect remains blazing fast; and much of this relates to all the ways it ensures state has truly changed for your components before allowing React to re-render.  The creator of Redux Dan Abramov did a podcast with Read The Source, to review the internals of react-redux's `Provider` and `connect`.  I highly recommend giving it an hour of your time as his explanation of this functionality far exceeds my own abilities. You can [check it out on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJ38wSFbM3A)

## Wrapping Up with Some Tests

Before we close out this chapter, we have two new areas of code that should probably have some test coverage.  Our action creators, and reducers.  

This is the first real testing we're doing on the client (aside from a quick smoketest we did on our App component).  So we'll need to decide how to setup our test files.  I prefer to keep my tests for the client in the same directory as the code under test.  It rankles a bit that we don't have the same setup for tests in both client and API (where everything is gathered in a single `spec/` directory). But the pain of having to modify my module import paths to account for tests being in a dedicated directory like our API has always put me off.  You can decide for yourself what you prefer.

## Testing Action Creators

Let's do some quick testing of our action creators, and introduce new concept; snapshot testing.  Create a file `src/actions/nodes.spec.js`.

``` javascript
/* global expect */
import * as actions from './nodes';

describe("Nodes actionCreators", ()=>{
  test("loadNodes(node)", ()=>{
    expect(actions.loadNodes([{contents: "Test node"}])).toMatchSnapshot();
  });
});
```

Since our action creators are simple object factories, I prefer to test them with snapshots.  If you haven't worked with snapshot tests before, Jest provides us with a helpful method `toMatchSnapshot()` which will create a new directory next to our testfile `__snapshots__`, and inside a file `nodes.spec.js.snap`.  That snapshot file will contain an object map of our test outcome the first time our test suite runs.  On later suite executions, our expectation will check to ensure that the produced outcome of our expectation matches the expectation, and fail the test if they are not a match.

This can be particularly helpful when testing objects as the outcomes of the test, as the snapshot will enforce deep equality, or produce a failing test.  There's a balance here we need to respect though; snapshot testing is dead simple, and fast to write.  But the expectations tested are also fairly stupid; either the test value exactly matches the snapshot we have on record, or it doesn't.  For example changing our node contents passed to the action creator even slightly, will fail the test: `expect(actions.loadNodes([{contents: "Test node!"}])).toMatchSnapshot();`

```
expect(value).toMatchSnapshot()
    
    Received value does not match stored snapshot 1.
    
    - Snapshot
    + Received
    
     Object {
       "payload": Array [
         Object {
    -      "contents": "Test node",
    +      "contents": "Test node!",
         },
       ],
       "type": "LOAD_NODES",
     }
```

It's then up to you to review the diff produced by the failed test and determine if the test is truly a critical failure, or if the snapshot should be updated to match the new value.  Luckily, our action creators are themselves pretty simple functions.  So long as the structure of the FSA remains stable, the contents seldom matter.  This makes them ideal for snapshot tests.

## Testing your Reducers

Now let's take a look at our Reducer.  Create a new file `src/reducers/nodes.spec.js`.  

``` javascript
/* global expect */
import  nodesReducer, { sortNodes } from './nodes';
import * as actions from '../actions/nodes';

let defaultState = [];
let newState = [{contents: "Test node"}];

describe("nodes Reducer", ()=>{
  test("LOAD_NODES overwrites nodes array",()=>{
    expect(nodesReducer(defaultState,actions.loadNodes(newState))).toEqual(newState);
  });
});
```

Testing our reducers is trivial, because they're simple functions.  We can easily test them in insolation from our larger store because these functions allow us to pass in the current state, and an action and test an outcome.

So to test our "LOAD_NODES" or `loadNodes` action, we can simply define a default state, and new state.  Then invoke the action by passing the start state and an action to the reducer function, and test that the result matches our expectations.

We shoudld also test our sort function before we move on.  Let's setup some sample data for our test, and use a snapshot again to enforce our test expectation.

``` javascript
/* global expect */
import  nodesReducer, { sortNodes } from './nodes';
import * as actions from '../actions/nodes';

let defaultState = [];
let newState = [{contents: "Test node"}];
let sampleNodes = [
  {id: 4, chapter_id: 2, node_type: "paragraph", content: "Fourth"},
  {id: 3, chapter_id: 2, node_type: "paragraph", content: "Third"},
  {id: 7, chapter_id: 1, node_type: "paragraph", content: "Second"},
  {id: 6, chapter_id: 1, node_type: "paragraph", content: "First"}
];

describe("nodes Reducer", ()=>{
  test("nodesSort orders by chapter id and then node id", ()=>{
    expect(sortNodes(sampleNodes)).toMatchSnapshot();
  });
  
  test("LOAD_NODES overwrites nodes array",()=>{
    expect(nodesReducer(defaultState,actions.loadNodes(newState))).toEqual(newState);
  });
});
```

Notice I've give the `content` attribute of each sample node my expected position in the returned Array.  That will help me quickly review the snapshot in future test iterations if this test shold begin to fail.  This in my opinion is where snapshot tests excel.  We have a lot of expectations about sort order boiled into a single test.  We can review the snapshot once, and be sure we are happy.  Then forget about it, and move on trusting our snapshot will alert us in the future if somethings needs another look.

``` javascipt
// Jest Snapshot v1, https://goo.gl/fbAQLP

exports[`nodes Reducer nodesSort orders by chapter id and then node id 1`] = `
Array [
  Object {
    "chapter_id": 1,
    "content": "First",
    "id": 6,
    "node_type": "paragraph",
  },
  Object {
    "chapter_id": 1,
    "content": "Second",
    "id": 7,
    "node_type": "paragraph",
  },
  Object {
    "chapter_id": 2,
    "content": "Third",
    "id": 3,
    "node_type": "paragraph",
  },
  Object {
    "chapter_id": 2,
    "content": "Fourth",
    "id": 4,
    "node_type": "paragraph",

`;
```

Finally let's look at `src/app.test.js` which is failing since we wrapped our App component in `connect()`.

```
Invariant Violation: Could not find "store" in either the context or props of "Connect(App)". Either wrap the root component in a <Provider>, or explicitly pass "store" as a prop to "Connect(App)".
```

Luckily, the fix is easy and the error message makes the problem pretty clear.  Connect expects a `store` to be available either through a wrapping `Provider` element, or directly as a property of the component.  I prefer the later when testing connected components, so I'll update as follows.

``` javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import store from './reducers/store';
import App from './App';

it('renders without crashing', () => {
  const div = document.createElement('div');
  ReactDOM.render(<App store={store}/>, div);
});

```

There's still some console errors piping through my test suite where we haven't properly mocked out our API calls.  But since the direct use of API calls in our components is a wort I intend to remove in future iterations, I'm not concerned with this message for the moment.

## Finishing Up

We're now set up with Redux, and ready to state managing some more complex states.  Chapters 3 and 4 have involved a lot of prep work, and it might be occurring to you at this point we've now spent two chapters of our time to end up almost exactly where we started.  The good news is that most of the prep work is behind us, and we're ready to make some major changes to our application.  But it's worth noting the cost that comes along with Redux as tool.  The benefits for applications that manage a great deal of state on the client are immense.  But for simpler applications, you'd be wise to pick simpler tools.

The benefits of Redux come from having a centralized point to manage state for your application.  Just be sure you have enough state to justify the cost of setup
