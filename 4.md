# Chapter 4: The Client Store

Now that our API is helpfully spitting back JSON primed for use in our FSA, we are ready to upgrade our client to digest this information.  In this chapter, we will be setting up Redux to manage our client-side store, and preparing for all of the client side state we will need to manage in our application.

## Client-Side Data Structure 

A client-side data store, such as we find used in Redux is a JavaScript Object structure that stores our application state.

As we did with our database tables, we need to spend some time planning our client-side data structure.  The structure of our store is going to have a significant influence on the way we populate and access our application state.  There are two approaches we commonly see in store design: deep structures vs. broad structures.

Deep structures tend to use nesting of related elements to create their organization.  An example for our purposes might look like the following:

``` javascript
{
  content: [{chapter_id, title, nodes: [
    {node_id, markdown},{...}
  ]}]
}
```

Here we see our two data types represented, and at the simplest level, we have our chapters grouped into an array of objects.  We could order these elements inside our store to allow us to pull our chapters, and print them quickly.  Our nodes are a little more complicated.  We have nested the nodes for each chapter inside an object structure of the parent element (in this case chapters).  The advantage of this approach is the speed of access; if we want to pull all the nodes related to a specific chapter, we can do so quickly off that chapter relation.

The tradeoff is the complexity of populating this structure.  The drawback is harder to see with our simplified data model.  However, imagine this structure applied to our full data layout:

```
{
  content: [{chapter_id, title, sections: [
    { section_id, title, nodes: [
      { node_id, content }]
    }] 
  }]
}
```

You begin to see why this creates complexity when we need to load or update data.  If we need to update the nodes for a specific chapter/section, we would need to traverse the entire tree structure, find the content we need, and then make our updates.  To make that just a little more interesting, Redux needs us to return a **new** object, not an updated version of the old object reference.  

I admit this is mostly a matter of preference, but my I strongly favor the use of broad and flat Redux stores.

In our case this looks more like the following:

``` javascript
{
  chapters: [{id, title}, {...}]  
  sections: [{id, section_id, heading}, {...}]
  nodes: [{id, chapter_id, section_id, content},{...}]
}
```

With this structure, when we load new nodes, we can likely ignore the `chapters` and `sections` part of our store entirely.  Our reducers can enforce business rules that are relevant to each part of the store.  Moreover, we have a way to efficiently and flexibly load only parts of our store content.  

For the moment, as we did with our API, we are going to set aside the concept of sections entirely.  So our store plan looks like the following:

``` javascript
{
  chapters: [{id, title}, {...}]  
  nodes: [{id, chapter_id, content},{...}]
}
```

We are going to use our Active Record ID's to dictate content order.  This plan relies on our API to load content according to that ordering schema (so far so good).  We are also going to ensure our store's reducers **enforce** this rule.  When content loads to the store, we can ensure the arrays of chapters, or nodes sort according to that ID ordering schema.  So chapter.id == 1 gets positioned in front of chapter.id == 2.

Our lower level elements can enforce a multi-level sort, first sorting by the chapter_id value, and then the node's id value afterward.  

The reason for this policy is that it allows our React components to be stupid about such logic.  Would you prefer to sort and order your store on the fly every time you read the content?  Or, would you instead choose to enforce content rules in a central location, and know our components can just pick a starting point in the document and print content in the order given to them?  I know my vote.

## Installing Redux

We need to do a little setup before we can dive into our client work.

We are going to install Redux, as well as react-redux, which is the official store connector for usage with React.

```
npm install --save redux
npm install --save react-redux
```

We are going to need to set up our store, and a provide it to our React components before we can start working on developing our data structure.

For a start, let's look at providing our store to our application.  Create a new directory `src/reducers` inside your client folder structure.  Inside that directory, create a file `store.js`.  This file is the entry point into our Redux store logic; here we assemble our reducers into a single Root reducer function, apply middleware, set defaults for our application state and other tasks related to configuring our redux store. 

There's a lot that is possible in our Redux configuration, and if some of the terms above are foreign to you, do not fret.   For now, we are going to start small.

``` javascript(/reactive-client/src/reducers/store.js)
import { createStore } from "redux";

const store = createStore((state,action) => state);

export default store;
```

We are using a method `createStore` provided to us by Redux to instantiate a new store.  You'll notice inside we're providing a function as a parameter for the store: `createStore((state,action) => state);`.  That function is for the moment serving as our reducer.  A reducer, if you are not already familiar, is a function that at its simplest takes two arguments; the current state of our store, and an action.  Reducers always return either a **new** state object or the current state object, without alterations.  

This simple function, therefore, meets the criteria of a Reducer, by always returning the unaltered application state.  When we write true reducers, they serve to build an updated application state in response to actions dispatched to our store. 

We are going to revisit this concept in a moment, once we have wired in our store to our React components.

Open `src/index.js` and modify it as follows:

``` javascript(/reactive-client/src/index.js)
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
+ import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
+ import store from './reducers/store';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';
import registerServiceWorker from './registerServiceWorker';

+ window.store = store;

ReactDOM.render(
+   <Provider store={store}>
+       <App />
+   </Provider>
  ,document.getElementById('root')
);
    
registerServiceWorker();
```

We are wrapping our top level `App` component inside the High Order Component `Provider`, given to us by react-redux.  Provider makes our `store` available to each of our components.  The documentation for Redux explains that you could accomplish a similar pattern by passing the store manually through your component properties, such as `<App store={store} />`.  However, this would quickly become tedious, as we have many components in our hierarchy that have no direct need of the store. However, these components would still be responsible for passing the store through the properties of any child components they might render, so it was available to them if needed.  Provider, takes care of this for us somewhat automagically.

Notice I have also assigned our store to the Browser's `window` object.  This step makes our store available to us in the Browser console, a tool which I find very useful for testing and debugging purposes.

Now let's talk about reducers.  What we said above is that a reducer is a function which takes a state and an action and returns a new state.  

Before we look at that, we should probably quickly discuss again what an action is.  Redux builds on the Flux pattern, and therefore uses Flux Standard Actions, or FSA as a primary component of its architecture.  For brevity’s sake, most people just refer to FSA as "actions."  However, an action you might remember from the last chapter is simply an object, which follows the pattern `{type: "SOME_KEY", payload: { some_data: "stuff"}}`.  The type parameter is a unique name for the action inside of our application and tells our reducers whether or not they need to operate on a dispatched action.  The `payload` of an action should contain all the information our reducers need to act on that action.

When we dispatch an action to our store, such as: `store.dispatch({type: "SOME_KEY", payload: { some_data: "stuff"}}` the action gets passed to our reducer functions, which check the value of `type`, and respond as needed.  While it is possible to house all of our reducer logic in a single reducer function, the more common approach is to use a nested reducer structure, where one reducer operates at the top level and defers ownership of smaller areas of the states to nested reducer functions. In this way, we can create a separation of concerns with our application logic.  In our case, this means we can expect to end up with dedicated reducers for our node state, our chapter state, perhaps our sections, and maybe an area of user content; who knows.

When an action dispatches to our store, it passes through ALL of our reducers, and the `type` attribute dictates which reducers respond, and how.

The action should also contain everything else in the payload (other attributes) that the reducer needs to accomplish the given action's intended transformation of the state. Our reducers contain logic within them that reads the current state from our store, and then using the action payload, returns a **new** object for our application state.  Otherwise, if the action type is not relevant for that particular reducer, then the reducer returns the current unaltered state.

Let's add an action to our Reducer.

``` javascript(/reactive-client/src/reducers/store.js)
import { createStore } from "redux";

+ let default_state = {nodes: []};

const store = createStore(
+   function(state = default_state,action){
+     switch (action.type) {
+       case("LOAD_NODES"):
+         return Object.assign({},state,
+         { nodes: action.payload}
+         );
+       default:
+         return state;
+     }
+   }
);

export default store;
```

Now our reducer has instructions on how to handle a new action type: "LOAD_NODES".  When this action dispatches, we use `Object.assign` to build a new state object.  The assign method merges several objects into a new object; note that we pass an object literal as the first parameter to ensure we end this process with a **new** and not updated state object.  This pattern of returning of a **new** object is critical for React/Redux to identify correctly when the state has updated, and where.  `Object.assign()` merges keys for each object passed as parameters, giving preference to the later members to of the attribute list when keys overlap.  

Notice our function definition has changed to assign a default state by setting a default value for the state parameter of our store. This use of default parameter values is one of the ways Redux gives us to instantiate our store with a default state.

Open your Browser, and load your application.  Let's run some commands in the console.

``` javascript
store.getState();
store.dispatch({type: "LOAD_NODES", payload: [{id: 1, chapter_id: 1, content: "# Some Heading"}]})
store.getState();
store.dispatch({type: "SOME_ACTION", payload: "Somes stuff"})
store.getState();
```

This example is why I like to make the store available on the browser's window.  When we add new actions, we can quickly validate our reducer actions by doing some test dispatches to our store.

On the first call to `store.getState()` we see our default returned, including an empty array of nodes.  Then our first dispatched action, loads in an example node, and our state is updated to reflect this new array.  Then another action is dispatched, but the state comes back to us unaltered because it is not a type our reducers currently manage.  

That is the most straightforward representation I can give you of the reducer pattern; we operate on what we understand and own and ignore what we do not.

## Combine Reducers 

Our life would get unwieldy fast if we needed to manage all of our state from a single reducer for an application of any real size.  Redux though, helpfully provides us with a way to split out concerns for our state into separate sub-reducers using a helper function `combineReducers()`.

Let's make some modifications to our Reducer setup, by splitting off our nodes reducers as its own function.  Create a new file `reducers/nodes`.

``` javascript(/reactive-client/src/reducers/nodes.js)
let default_state = [];

const nodesReducer = function(state = default_state,action){
  switch (action.type) {
    case("LOAD_NODES"):
      return [...action.payload];
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

export default nodesReducer;
```

This modification is an almost straight migration of the reducer function we wrote a moment ago, with a few small modifications. Look first at our new default state variable, now set to a simple array literal, rather than our previous value `{nodes: []}`.  This change gives us a clue as to what is happening.  Rather than managing the entire state tree, we are setting up this reducer to own just one concern, in this case, the array of nodes in our book.  As such that is the **only** slice of the state this reducer can manage.

As a result, our action `LOAD_NODES` changed, now we are no longer returning an object, but rather an array of our nodes.  One thing has not changed, it that we are still returning new state objects, rather than updating the existing state.  We can do this using the array literal syntax and spread operator to set up a new array with all the nodes from our action payload.  

Just as we saw before, if our reducer does not know how to handle an action type, it returns an unaltered copy of the state (in this case the existing array of nodes.)

Now let's update our `store.js` file to use this new reducer.

``` javascript(/reactive-client/src/reducers/store.js)
+ import { createStore, combineReducers } from "redux";
+ import nodes from './nodes';

const store = createStore(
+   combineReducers({nodes})
);

export default store;
```

First, we are going to import our new `nodesReducer()` function as a module under the name `nodes`.  Then update the create store method to use the combineReducers helper function, we pass it an Object whose keys include our imported reducer.

Let's revisit the browser console and look at our default state.

``` javascript
JSON.stringify(store.getState())
"{"nodes":[]}"
```

Our default state is back where we started.  The difference now is that our nodes reducer can painlessly operate on the `nodes` array in our state, without needing to be aware of the rest of our state tree.  

Where did the `nodes` key name come from in our state tree though?  That is a small gift of ES2015's object destructing syntax.  When we passed `combineReducers` an object with our imported `nodes` reducer, we did not explicitly assign a key name for the object's attribute, so the parser assumes that the variable we name passed matches the value we want to assign as the attribute key.  We could have passed `combineReducers({nodes: nodes})` to the same result.

## Domain Specific Reducer Logic

One of my favorite things about this pattern with reducers is that it defines for us clear operating areas for managing each part of our application state.  

We said at the start of this chapter that we want to enforce our content order in our reducers to simplify the ability of our components to make use of our book contents.  Now that a dedicated reducer manages our node state, we can expand our reducer logic to include a sort check of our nodes array on appropriate actions.

``` javascript(/reactive-client/src/reducers/nodes.js)
let default_state = [];

+ export const sortNodes = (nodes) => {
+   return nodes.sort((a,b) =>{
+     if(a.chapter_id === b.chapter_id){
+       return a.id - b.id;
+     } else {
+       return a.chapter_id - b.chapter_id;
+     }
+   });
+ };

const nodesReducer = function(state = default_state,action){
  switch (action.type) {
    case("LOAD_NODES"):
+       return [...sortNodes(action.payload)];
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

export default nodesReducer;
```

We have now defined a new function `sortNodes`, which orders our nodes array before updating the store.  This function first enforces a sort order on the nodes' chapter_id values and then performs a secondary sort on the node ID.  That sorted array gets returned, where we then continue to use the array literal syntax and spread operator to return a new array instance for our state.

## Structuring our Client Project

Now that we have our store and reducer in place, we should set up some other convenience features to make working with our store easier.  Personally, I favor the use of constants, and action creator functions when working with my store.

### Constants Over Strings

The constants are the easier of these two to tackle so start there, setting up a new folder and file `src/constants/nodes.js`.  Inside it place the following:

``` javascript(/reactive-client/src/constants/nodes.js)
export const LOAD_NODES = "LOAD_NODES";
```

Our constants file serves to give us a defined list of accepted `type` values for our store.  An FSA can accept **any** value in the type attribute of our actions.  Since our store will just happily return the current state anytime it does not have a defined response for the dispatched action's type; our store "fails" rather silently if we pass it "LOAD_NODE", when we mean to pass "LOAD_NODES".  Setting up our reducers to use a defined list of constants will give us a limited list of keys to draw from.  If you’re using an IDE that helps you complete variable names, all the better.

Let's update our reducer to use this constants file.

``` javascript(/reactive-client/src/constants/nodes.js)
+ import * as constants from '../constants/nodes';

let default_state = [];

- export const sortNodes = (nodes) => {
-   return nodes.sort((a,b) =>{
-     if(a.chapter_id === b.chapter_id){
-       return a.id - b.id;
-     } else {
-       return a.chapter_id - b.chapter_id;
-     }
-   });
- };

const nodesReducer = function(state = default_state,action){
  switch (action.type) {
+     case(constants.LOAD_NODES):
      return [...sortNodes(action.payload)];
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

export default nodesReducer;
```

Note the `import * as ...` module import at the top of the file.  You might not be familiar with this ES2015 module syntax yet, but it is going to be a big help to us.  The `import * as ...` pattern imports all the exportable items from the referenced file under a namespace given in the directive.  In our case, all our constants come back to us under the namespace `constants` and are accessible as chained properties.  This lets us write nice readable code in our case statements `case(constants.LOAD_NODES)`.

### Action Creators

Now let's turn to our action creators.  As the name implies, action creators create actions.  Since we use our FSA a lot, it helps us to have these stored in a central location, and to have a function that creates the FSA for us with minimal fuss.  If in the future the structure of our action or its payload needs to change, we can update the action creator function rather than have to chase down every single use of that action type scattered throughout our application.

Create a file and folder path `src/actions/nodes.js` and set up the following.

``` javascript(/reactive-client/src/actions/nodes.js)
import * as constants from '../constants/nodes';

export const loadNodes = (payload) => ({type: constants.LOAD_NODES, payload});
```

We use the same import strategy for our constants here that we did for our reducer.  Then we define a new exportable, a function `loadNodes` which takes a payload of information and returns an FSA for us.  We are also using an ES2015 shortcut in our function definition.  By wrapping the function body in parentheses `({})` we indicate we wish the function to return an object literal.  We are then further simplifying the syntax by using the object attribute naming shorthand we introduced earlier this chapter.  Since we are not defining a property name for the `payload` variable we assign into the object; the name of that attribute matches our variable name, in this case `payload`.

The more verbose version of this function would have been.

``` javascript
export const loadNodes = (payload) => {
  return {type: constants.LOAD_NODES, payload: payload}
}
```

Either way, the resulting FSA returned to us takes the form needed for our reducer.

## Bringing it All Together

Now we are ready to update our `App` component to make use of our Redux store, rather than maintaining its own state object.

We are going to do that with the help of the `react-redux` package we installed at the start of this chapter.  More specifically, the `connect` method it provides.  Put simply connect helps us tie our component's properties to our Redux store state, and also provides a way for us to dispatch actions to our Redux store from within a component.  Let's look at the `connect` function a bit before we get started.

`connect` exist to give you a mechanism for mapping the state of your Redux store into the properties of your components.  The connect function itself though has a somewhat usual syntax:

``` javascript
connect(mapStateToProps, actionCreators)(Component)
```

Notice the double parentheses on this function evocation.  This invocation needed because the `connect` function will itself return a function, which is then immediately invoked with a component as its argument.  That returned function then constructs a new component, whose properties are a merge of the items from your store you have connected to the component, and that components own properties.  

Let's take a look at it in action by modifying our App Component.

``` javascript(/reactive-client/src/App.js)
import React, { Component } from 'react';
+ import { connect } from 'react-redux';
+ import {loadNodes } from './actions/nodes';
import axios from 'axios';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';

+ const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
+   book_body: state.nodes
+ });

+ const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => ({
+   dispatchLoadNodes: (payload) => dispatch(loadNodes(payload))
+ });

class App extends Component {
  componentWillMount(){
    axios.get("/api/nodes")
    .then(
      (response) => {
+         this.props.dispatchLoadNodes(response.data);
      }
    )
    .catch(
      (error) => {
        console.log(error);
      }
    );
  }
  
  renderContentBlocks = (content) => {
    let content_blocks = [];
    content.forEach((block) => {content_blocks.push(<p key={content_blocks.length}>{block.content}</p>)});
    return content_blocks;
  }
  
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <div className="App-header">
          <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
          <h2>Reactivating Rails: A work in progress</h2>
        </div>
        <div className="App-intro">
          { this.renderContentBlocks(this.props.book_body) }
        </div>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

+ export default connect(
+   mapStateToProps,
+   mapDispatchToProps
+ )(App);
```

We begin by defining two functions `mapStateToProps` and `mapDispatchToProps`.  As their names imply, these functions map elements of our store state to the wrapped component's properties.  `mapStateToProps` will be passed a reference to our store, enabling us to select elements from our state (in this case `nodes`), and map them to the properties of our components.

Similarly, `mapDispatchToProps` is passed a reference to our `store.dispatch` function, and can be used to bind our action creator functions to a component's properties.  This connection gives our components an easy way to dispatch actions when modifications to the state are needed.  Our App component now uses our `loadNodes` action creator to populate our nodes to the store when our API request completes.  This dispatch replaces the direct modification of the component's state using `setState` we saw previously.

I tend to name my dispatch functions `dispatchActionCreator` to make it clear which properties of my components trigger dispatches to the store.  So in this case, we've defined `dispatchLoadNodes` as a function, which will take a single argument (our nodes array).  When invoked, our action creator produces a complete FSA and dispatches the action to our store.

Notice that the references to `this.state` have changed to `this.props` in the components other methods.  This shift happens because connect works to pass our store state through to our components as **props**.   Our components can still maintain their own state separate from Redux's store using `this.state` and the `setState` functions.  This use of dual state is a common design, but anything fed into our components from Redux, arrives in our components as props.

Finally, we call connect and pass it our two mapping functions, and the App component itself.  This invocation becomes the new default exportable for our file, causing references to `App` in other files such as `index.js` now received this connected component.  

This first component is an admittedly shallow look at what connect does.  When you are comfortable with its basic uses, I strongly recommend a more in-depth investigation into this library.  There's an impressive amount of logic built into the way connect manages binding components to your store state to ensure that connect remains blazing fast.  Much of this speed relates to all the ways it ensures the state has genuinely changed for your components before allowing React to re-render.  The creator of Redux, Dan Abramov did a podcast with Read The Source, to review the internals of react-redux's `Provider` and `connect`.  I highly recommend giving it an hour of your time as his explanation of this functionality far exceeds my own abilities. You can [check it out on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJ38wSFbM3A)

## Wrapping Up with Some Tests

Before we close out this chapter, our action creators and reducers would benefit from some test coverage.

These tests are the first real testing we have done for the client.  We need to decide how to set up our test files.  I prefer to keep my tests for the client in the same directory as the code under test.  It rankles a bit that we do not have the same setup for tests in both client and API (where everything resides in a single `spec/` directory).  

Unlike with Rails though, with Jest, we do not have access to the full application environment.  Instead, we need to explicitly import the modules of our application we want to put under test.  Having the spec files live in the same directory as the code under test makes these import paths much shorter, and resistant to typos.  You can decide for yourself what you prefer.

## Testing Action Creators

Let's do some quick testing of our action creators, and introduce a new concept; snapshot testing.  Create a file `src/actions/nodes.spec.js`.

``` javascript(/reactive-client/src/actions/nodes.spec.js)
/* global expect */
import * as actions from './nodes';

describe("Nodes actionCreators", ()=>{
  test("loadNodes(node)", ()=>{
    expect(actions.loadNodes([{contents: "Test node"}])).toMatchSnapshot();
  });
});
```

Since our action creators are simple object factories, I prefer to test them with snapshots.  If you have not worked with snapshot tests before, Jest provides us with a helpful method `toMatchSnapshot()` which creates a new directory next to our test file `__snapshots__`, and inside a file named `nodes.spec.js.snap`.  That snapshot file contains an object map of our test outcome from the first time our test suite runs.  On later suite executions, our expectation checks to ensure that the produced outcome of our expectation matches the snapshot, and fails the test if they are not a match.

This feature can be particularly helpful when testing objects as the outcomes of a test, as the snapshot enforces deep equality, otherwise flagging a failing test.  There's a balance here we need to respect though; snapshot testing is dead simple, and fast to write.  However, the expectations tested are also fairly stupid; either the test value exactly matches the snapshot we have on record, or it does not.  For example, changing our node contents passed to the action creator even slightly fails the test.  

Update your test to the following for example, and see the report produced in your terminal: `expect(actions.loadNodes([{contents: "Test node!"}])).toMatchSnapshot();`

``` bash
expect(value).toMatchSnapshot()
    
    Received value does not match stored snapshot 1.
    
    - Snapshot
    + Received
    
     Object {
       "payload": Array [
         Object {
    -      "contents": "Test node",
    +      "contents": "Test node!",
         },
       ],
       "type": "LOAD_NODES",
     }
```

It is then up to you to review the diff produced by the failed test and determine if the test is indeed a critical failure, or if the snapshot should be updated to match the new value.  Luckily, our action creators are themselves pretty simple functions.  So long as the structure of the FSA remains stable, the exact contents seldom matter, making them ideal for snapshot tests.

## Testing your Reducers

Now let's take a look at our Reducer.  Create a new file `src/reducers/nodes.spec.js`.  

``` javascript(/reactive-client/src/reducers/nodes.spec.js)
/* global expect */
import  nodesReducer, { sortNodes } from './nodes';
import * as actions from '../actions/nodes';

let defaultState = [];
let newState = [{contents: "Test node"}];

describe("nodes Reducer", ()=>{
  test("LOAD_NODES overwrites nodes array",()=>{
    expect(nodesReducer(defaultState,actions.loadNodes(newState))).toEqual(newState);
  });
});
```

Setting up to test a reducer is trivial because they are simple functions.  We can quickly test them in isolation from our larger store because these functions allow us to pass in the current state, and an action and test an outcome.

So to test our "LOAD_NODES" or `loadNodes` action, we can just define a default state and new state for our test.  Then we invoke the action and test that the result matches our expectations.

We should also test our sort function before we move on.  Let's set up some sample data for our test, and use a snapshot again to enforce our test expectation.

``` javascript(/reactive-client/src/reducers/nodes.spec.js)
/* global expect */
import  nodesReducer, { sortNodes } from './nodes';
import * as actions from '../actions/nodes';

let defaultState = [];
let newState = [{contents: "Test node"}];
+ let sampleNodes = [
+   {id: 4, chapter_id: 2, node_type: "paragraph", content: "Fourth"},
+   {id: 3, chapter_id: 2, node_type: "paragraph", content: "Third"},
+   {id: 7, chapter_id: 1, node_type: "paragraph", content: "Second"},
+   {id: 6, chapter_id: 1, node_type: "paragraph", content: "First"}
+ ];

describe("nodes Reducer", ()=>{
+   test("nodesSort orders by chapter id and then node id", ()=>{
+     expect(sortNodes(sampleNodes)).toMatchSnapshot();
+   });
  
-   test("LOAD_NODES overwrites nodes array",()=>{
-     expect(nodesReducer(defaultState,actions.loadNodes(newState))).toEqual(newState);
-   });
});
```

Notice I have given the `content` attribute of each sample node my expected position in the returned Array.  That might help me quickly review the snapshot in future test iterations if this test should begin to fail.  This in my opinion is where snapshot tests excel.  We have many expectations about sort order boiled into a single test.  We can review the snapshot once, and be sure we are happy.  Then forget about it, and move on trusting our snapshot to alert us in the future if something needs another look.

``` javascipt
// Jest Snapshot v1, https://goo.gl/fbAQLP

exports[`nodes Reducer nodesSort orders by chapter id and then node id 1`] = `
Array [
  Object {
    "chapter_id": 1,
    "content": "First",
    "id": 6,
    "node_type": "paragraph",
  },
  Object {
    "chapter_id": 1,
    "content": "Second",
    "id": 7,
    "node_type": "paragraph",
  },
  Object {
    "chapter_id": 2,
    "content": "Third",
    "id": 3,
    "node_type": "paragraph",
  },
  Object {
    "chapter_id": 2,
    "content": "Fourth",
    "id": 4,
    "node_type": "paragraph",
  },
]
`;
```

Finally, let's look at `src/app.test.js` which is failing since we wrapped our App component in `connect()`.

```
Invariant Violation: Could not find "store" in either the context or props of "Connect(App)". Either wrap the root component in a <Provider>, or explicitly pass "store" as a prop to "Connect(App)".
```

Luckily, the fix is straightforward, and the error message makes the problem pretty explicit.  Connect expects a `store` to be available either through a wrapping `Provider` element, or directly as a property of the component.  Passing store directly as a prop for the component requires us to also pass that property to any child components we later render from App.  So I opt to let Provider do our heavy lifting.

``` javascript(/reactive-client/src/App.test.js)
import React from 'react';
+ import {Provider} from 'react-reduax';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import store from './reducers/store';
import App from './App';

it('renders without crashing', () => {
  const div = document.createElement('div');
+   ReactDOM.render(<Provider store={store}><App /></Provider>, div);
});

```

There's still some console errors piping through my test suite where we have not correctly mocked out our API calls.  Since the direct use of API calls in our components is a wort I intend to remove in future iterations though, I am unconcerned with this message for the moment.

## Finishing Up

We are now set up with Redux, and ready to start managing some more complex states.  Chapters 3 and 4 have involved a lot of prep work, and it might be occurring to you at this point we have now spent two chapters of our time to end up almost exactly where we started.  The good news is that most of the prep work is behind us, and we are ready to make some significant changes to our application.  However, it is worth noting the cost that comes along with Redux as a tool.  The benefits for applications that manage a great deal of state on the client are immense.  For uncomplicated applications though, you might be wise to pick simpler tools.

The benefits of Redux come from having a centralized point to manage state for your application.  Just be sure you have enough state to justify the cost of setup.
