# Chapter 4: Organizing Data Tables

Our next iteration divides across two chapters; the first deals with our API, while chapter 5 covers our corresponding React changes. We are creating a data storage layer on both our client and server to manage the content of our book.  We start with ActiveRecord and creating models for our data. Then create a Rake task to parse our Markdown content.   Let's get started.

## Getting Started 

If you're starting here or jumping between chapters, I recommend executing the code below to clone the project and check out the branch for this chapter.

``` bash
# Copy and paste the following commands to check out the starter commit
git clone https://github.com/swachtma/reactivating-rails-app.git && \
cd reactivating-rails-app && \
git checkout ch4-starter
```

## All Content is Not Created Equal

Currently, our application treats all content as simple text blocks, but markdown hides nuance in its simple syntax.  Our chapters consist of paragraphs, code snippets, lists, headings, tables, images, links, and other formats.

We also have a document taxonomy to honor.  A book is not just a collection of random elements.   There is an organizational structure we need to preserve.  We need a database structure mirroring our content's schema. One which also provides metadata needed for our client to render markdown in the browser appropriately.

## What's on (in) the Table?

Let's think about how our book should divide into database tables and relationships.

Since we only have one book to display, having a `Books` table seems overkill.  Chapters seem a more logical division, as do individual paragraphs or "nodes" of text. 

In our case, chapters are the individual MD files we parse.  Nodes are the top level divisions (blocks) in our markdown.   Each node is one of a variety of possible "types" denoting how content should render (code fences, paragraphs, lists, and so on).

Consider the relationships between our elements: 
* A book has many chapters
    * A chapter belongs to a book
    * A chapter has many nodes
      * A node belongs to a chapter

If we don't include a `Books` model, then we only need to represent two relationships in our tables.

* A chapter has many nodes
    * A node belongs to a chapter

We'll revisit the other relationships later if and when our application demands them.

With all that in mind, here's our plan for this iteration:
* Create tables for our new models
* Define model relationships
* Change the import of our book from a controller action to a runnable task
* Modify our controller action to pass a JSON response ready for our client.

## Setting Up Tables

Let's start by creating some tables and their ActiveRecord models.  I prefer to do this using Rail's model generators as they produce both a migration for our database setup and a class in our `models/` directory we can modify.

Run the following generator commands in your terminal.  (Remember your containers must be running before you can execute commands with the `docker-compose exec` prefix.)

``` bash
docker-compose exec api rails generate model Chapter title:string

docker-compose exec api rails generate model Node chapter_id:integer node_type:string content:text

docker-compose exec api rails db:migrate
```

Next go ahead and declare relationships for your models.

``` ruby(/api/app/models/chapter.rb)
class Chapter < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :nodes
end
```

``` ruby(/api/app/models/block.rb)
class Node < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :chapter
end
```

Simple; now we can turn our attention towards improving content parsing.

## Creating a Task

I admitted when creating the `books#index` action we were committing some sins.

Our controller action has no business parsing our book.   Not just for reason of conventions; it is hugely inefficient to repeat this work on every controller request.  Now is our chance to clean up by migrating this work to a rake task.

A Rake task is a repeatable script our application needs to run either intermittently or on a schedule.   Rails provides many default tasks such as `db:migrate` which we just ran to create database tables.  It also provides a generator for constructing custom tasks.  That generator command takes the following form: `rails generate task [namespace] [action] [...action]`

Try running the following in your terminal.

``` bash
docker-compose exec api rails generate task rr load_book clear_book
```

This generator creates two tasks; `rr:load_book` and `rr:clear_book`.

Open the generated task file.

``` ruby(/api/lib/tasks/rr.rake)
namespace :rr do
  desc "TODO"
+   task load_book: :environment do
  end

  desc "TODO"
+   task clear_book: :environment do
  end
end
```

Both generated tasks list an `:environment` dependency which allows full access to our Rails environment.   That means we can do things like query and load data into our ActiveRecord models from within our task.

Before we begin writing, let's relocate the importer classes we created in the last chapter.  Move the file to the `lib/` directory since it's no longer directly invoked in our controller. As you move the file, modify the class as shown below to load data into our newly created tables.

``` ruby(/api/lib/book_file_finder.rb)
class BookFileFinder
  attr_reader :entries
  
  def initialize(path)
    @path = normalize_folder(path) 
+     @entries = validate_chapters
  end
  
  private
-     def normalize_folder(path)
-       path[-1] == "/" ? path : path + "/"
-     end
    
-     def locate_chapter_files
-        raw_file_list = expand_file_paths(Dir.entries(@path))
-        filter_chapter_files(raw_file_list);
-     end

+     def validate_chapters
+       all_entries = locate_chapter_files.sort!
+       all_entries.delete_if do |file|
+         load_or_invalidate_chapter(file)
+       end
+     end
+           
+     def load_or_invalidate_chapter(file)
+       invalid =  true
+       md_doc = CommonMarker.render_doc(File.read(file))
+       md_doc.each do |node|
+         if node.type == :header
+           invalid = false
+           Chapter.create(title: node.to_commonmark)
+           break
+         end
+       end
+             
+       return invalid
+     end
    
-     def filter_chapter_files(raw_file_list)
-         raw_file_list.select do |file|
-             File.file?(file) && \
-             File.extname(file) == ".md" && \
-             !/readme\.md/i.match?(file)
-         end
-     end
    
-     def expand_file_paths(file_array)
-       file_array.map do |file|
-         @path + file
-       end
-     end
end
```

I am adding a business rule to our book's chapters that each file must have at least one heading tag to be considered valid. Moreover, the first heading found provides the text for the chapter's title.

To do this, we pass each file through a new `validate_chapter` method.  Using the `delete_if` array enumerator, we test each file in another new method, `load_or_invalidate_chapter`.  This second method traverses the file searching for a node with the type "heading".  When we find a heading, we create a new database record for the chapter and break from our loop.  Files without a valid heading return as invalid to the outer loop of `validate_chapter`, removing them from the entries array.

Now let's write some logic into our Rake task.

``` ruby(/api/lib/tasks/rr.rake)
require "#{Rails.root}/lib/loader/book_file_finder"

namespace :rr do
  desc "Import content at lib/reactivating-rails/"
  task load_book: :environment do
+     puts "Loading book content..."
+     entries = BookFileFinder.new("#{Rails.root}/lib/reactivating-rails")
  end

  desc "Clear content of previously loaded iterations"
  task clear_book: :environment do
    puts "Clearing book content..."
  end
end
```

To start the `rr:load_book` task, we call our file finder class with our book's directory.  Go ahead and run the task using the following terminal command: `docker-compose exec api bin/rails rr:load_book`

There's not much to see, but if we open an IRB console (`docker-compose run api bin/rails console`), we can query ActiveRecord to see our progress.  In your IRB console run `Chapter.last`.  You should see something like:

``` bash
=> #<Chapter id: 16, title: "# Chapter 9: High Order Components\n", created_at: "2018-09-09 03:23:26", updated_at: "2018-09-09 03:23:26">
```

A good start, but we are not getting much feedback from our task as it runs.  Adding some console reporting would signal where to start digging if something goes awry in our task.  I also think we are now overreaching in our `BookFileFinder` class.  The chapter validation process is unclear, and that's probably a sign we are doing too much in one class.

Let's move the Chapter validation into a class of its own:

``` ruby(/api/lib/chapter_file.rb)
class ChapterFile
  attr_reader :title, :body, :record
  
  def initialize(file)
    @file_path = file
    @body = CommonMarker.render_doc(File.read(file))
  end
  
  public
    def save
      unless self.invalid?
        puts "Creating chapter: #{@record.title}"
        @record.save
      end
    end
    
    def invalid?
      @body.each do |node|
        if node.type == :header
          @record = Chapter.new(title: node.to_plaintext.strip)
          return false
        end
      end
      puts "#{@file_path} removed as invalid chapter."
      return true
    end
end
```

We're creating two public methods for this class: `save` and `invalid?`. 

The `invalid?` method traverses the file as we saw earlier, setting up an unsaved Chapter instance upon finding a suitable title.  If no heading nodes are present, the method returns true to signal removal of the file.

The `save` method now stand alone so we can be deliberate about when this happens in the context of our Rake task.

We're also creating attribute readers as interfaces to several levels of our markdown:
* `:body`, which contains the full text of the chapter
* `:title`, to store our assigned title.
* And `:record`, which stores our ActiveRecord model instance.  
 
Keeping the record's ActiveRecord instance available helps us when we need to create associated `Nodes` for each chapter in our database. Instead of passing around ID values, we can use method chaining such as `chapter.node.create`.

Now we can update our Rake task to use this new class.

``` ruby(/api/lib/tasks/rr.rake)
require "#{Rails.root}/lib/book_file_finder"
require "#{Rails.root}/lib/chapter_file"

namespace :rr do
  desc "Import content at lib/reactivating-rails/"
  task load_book: :environment do
    puts "Loading book content..."
    entries = BookFileFinder.new("#{Rails.root}/lib/reactivating-rails").entries
    
+     entries.delete_if do |file|
+       ChapterFile.new(file).invalid?
+     end
+     
+     entries.each do |file|
+       chapter = ChapterFile.new(file)
+       chapter.save
+     end
  end

  desc "Clear content of previously loaded iterations"
-   task clear_book: :environment do
-     puts "Clearing book content..."
-   end
end
```

We are splitting our work with the `ChapterFiles` class across two iterations through the collection:  
 1. Using `delete_if`, we remove any invalid chapter instances.
 2. Then we pass through the remainder to save the valid files.

This approach bears the inefficiency of running our validation twice for each chapter.  However, in exchange, we get clean, clear ruby in our task.  I can accept that tradeoff in code run so infrequently.

Now, remove our Chapter validation from the `BookFileFinder` class.

``` ruby(/api/lib/book_file_finder.rb)
class BookFileFinder
  attr_reader :entries
  
  def initialize(path)
     @path = normalize_folder(path) 
     @entries = locate_chapter_files.sort_by! {|x| File.basename(x,".md").to_i}
  end
  
  private
    def normalize_folder(path)
      path[-1] == "/" ? path : path + "/"
    end
    
    def locate_chapter_files
       raw_file_list = expand_file_paths(Dir.entries(@path))
       filter_chapter_files(raw_file_list);
    end
    
    def filter_chapter_files(raw_file_list)
        raw_file_list.select do |file|
            File.file?(file) && \
            File.extname(file) == ".md" && \
            !/readme\.md/i.match?(file)
        end
    end
    
    def expand_file_paths(file_array)
      # Array.map allows us to iterate through the array
      # updating each by concatenating the directory path onto the file name
      file_array.map do |file|
        @path + file
      end
    end
end
```

Let's rerun our rake task; first, clear your tables with `docker-compose exec api rails db:reset`.  Then run `docker-compose exec api bin/rails rr:load_book` and you should see output like the following.

``` bash
Creating chapter: Chapter 1: Introduction
Creating chapter: Chapter 2: React, Rails, and Docker (Oh my).
Creating chapter: Chapter 3: Loading and Displaying Basic Content
...
```

Recheck your database in the Rails console with `Chapter.all.count`.  You should see a Chapter record created for each chapter file.

The next step for us to tackle is parsing our blocks.  Since we already loop our Chapters for our `chapter.save` call, our work should be trivial.

``` ruby(/api/lib/tasks/rr.rake)
require "#{Rails.root}/lib/book_file_finder"
require "#{Rails.root}/lib/chapter_file"

namespace :rr do
  desc "Import content at lib/reactivating-rails/"
  task load_book: :environment do
    puts "Loading book content..."
    entries = BookFileFinder.new("#{Rails.root}/lib/reactivating-rails").entries
    
    entries.delete_if do |file|
      ChapterFile.new(file).invalid?
    end
    
    entries.each do |file|
      chapter = ChapterFile.new(file)
      chapter.save
      
+       chapter.body.each do |node|
+         chapter.record.nodes.create(
+           node_type: node.type.to_s, content: node.to_commonmark
+         )
+       end
    end
  end

  desc "Clear content of previously loaded iterations"
-   task clear_book: :environment do
-     puts "Clearing book content..."
-   end
end
```

Execute your task again (`docker-compose exec api rails rr:load_book`), and open an IRB console.  You should now see populated `Node` and `Chapter` tables if you do a bit of querying.

That completes our first task.  I am going to delay implementing its sibling, `rr:clear_book`.  We can skimp by using the default Rails task `bin/rails db:reset`, which clears all our tables, and resets our indexes to zero.  As we add more models to our application, purging the entire database might become untenable.  For now though, it meets our needs.  

If you ran the `rr:load_book` task several times this iteration, you should run `db:reset` and then `rr:load_book` again before moving forward to ensure you have clean data.

## Testing Our Importer

Before moving on, let's brush-up our test suite.

Our tests should be green, but new business rules for chapter creation need coverage.  Add a new document to your `testbook/` directory.  Name the file `invalidChapter.md`, populating it with the text below.

``` markdown(/api/spec/lib/testbook/invalidChapter.md)
Chapter.invalid? should return true when evaluating this file as it contains no valid heading to serve as a chapter title.
```

I'm also going to move `book_file_finder_spec.rb` , `book_file_parse_spec.rb`, and their associated `testbook/` directory into a `spec/lib/` folder to mirror our restructured `app/` directory.

If we rerun the spec now, our test `BookFileFinder removes readme.md, directories, and non-md files from return` fails.  Our file finder spec only confirms files as markdown and ensures that the file is not a directory or README.

Go ahead and update each spec as follows:

``` ruby(/api/spec/lib/book_file_finder_spec.rb)
require 'rails_helper'
require 'book_file_finder'

RSpec.describe BookFileFinder do
  it "removes readme.md, directories, and non-md files from return" do
+     path = "spec/lib/testbook/"
    entries = BookFileFinder.new(path).entries
+     expect(entries.length).to eq 2
    expect(entries[0]).to eq path+"mockChapter.md"
  end
  
  it "enforces proper file path" do
+     path = "spec/lib/testbook/"
+     bad_path = "spec/lib/testbook"
    expect(BookFileFinder.new(path).entries).to \
      eq BookFileFinder.new(bad_path).entries
  end
end
```

``` ruby(/api/spec/lib/book_file_parse_spec.rb)
require 'rails_helper'
require 'book_file_parser'

RSpec.describe BookFileParser do
  it "creates payload of top level blocks from array of MD files" do
+     payload = BookFileParser.new(["spec/lib/testbook/mockChapter.md"]).payload
    expect(payload.length).to eq 13
  end
end
```

We're now green except for the pending tests generated on our models.  Leave these be for now; there's no need to test these current trivial implementations.

However, let's add a spec for our chapter parser.

``` ruby(/api/spec/lib/chapter_file_spec.rb)
require 'rails_helper'
require 'chapter_file.rb'

RSpec.describe ChapterFile do
  it "invalidates chapters without titles/headings" do
    chapter_test = ChapterFile.new(
      "spec/lib/testbook/invalidChapter.md"
    ).invalid?
    expect(chapter_test).to be_truthy
  end
  
  describe "valid chapters" do
    before(:each) do
      @chapter = chapter = ChapterFile.new("spec/lib/testbook/mockChapter.md")
    end
    
    it "have headings/titles" do
      expect(@chapter.invalid?).to be_falsey
    end
    
    it "create model instances when saved" do
      @chapter.save
      expect(Chapter.all.count).to eq(1)
    end
  end
end
```

Rerun your specs to ensure everything is green.  Now, rake task in place, let's update our controller action to prepare it for working with our client-side data store (Redux).

## Fluxifying your Controller Actions

We need to put the cart before the horse for a minute and talk about Flux.

Flux is the data pattern underlying Redux.  In the simplest terms, Flux is a principle of unidirectional data flow.  Redux enforces this pattern by encapsulating all state changes in instructions passed to our data store called Flux Standard Actions (FSA), or usually just "actions" for short.

An action is an object that contains a type attribute, and a payload of other information required to perform the requested state change.  For example, `{type: "SOME_KEY", payload: {data: "stuff"}}`

When sent to our store, actions pass through a series of functions called reducers, which manage transformations of our application's state.
1. An action gets dispatched to the store.  
2. The store checks to see if it knows how to respond to the action key specified in the `type` attribute of the action.
3. If it does, the reducer creates a new state for our application.
4. If it does not, the state persists unaltered

Down the chain, our React components subscribe to changes on this application state.  When the state changes, the components rerender and the screen redraws as needed.

All that is to say, our controller actions should support this pattern, and send data easily composed into actions for our store.  We're close already, but there are a few things we can do to make this easier.

## Scoping our Model data

First, let's create a scope in our model that we can use to limit our queries.

Rails automatically generates default columns that we don't need in our client.  Fields such as `created_at`, and `updated_at` don't have much to offer us.

We can also use Active Record to enforce some conventions like sort order.    We might still reinforce this order on the client in cases where it is critical, but ActiveRecord makes sorting so easy, it seems a shame not to take advantage.

Let's open our `Node` model and add a scope.

``` ruby(/api/app/models/node.rb)
- # == Schema Information
- #
- # Table name: nodes
- #
- #  id         :integer          not null, primary key
- #  chapter_id :integer
- #  node_type  :string
- #  content    :text
- #  created_at :datetime         not null
- #  updated_at :datetime         not null
- #

class Node < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :chapter
  
+   scope :fsa, -> { 
+     order(chapter_id: :asc, id: :asc ).select(
+       :id, :chapter_id, :node_type, :content
+     )
+   }
end
```

We are creating a scope called `:fsa` in our model.  First ordering our content: chapters first, and then the nodes within.  Then limiting the columns selected to those we need.

Open the console, and try it out by running `Nodes.all.fsa`.  You should get back a response like the following:

``` bash
[#<Node id: 6, chapter_id: 1, node_type: "paragraph", content: "I'm also hoping this exercise will help me develop...">, #<Node id: 7, chapter_id: 1, node_type: "header", content: "## So, what are we building?\n">, #<Node id: 8, chapter_id: 1, node_type: "paragraph", content: "Together (In a non-linear timey-wimey sense), we a...">, #<Node id: 9, chapter_id: 1, node_type: "paragraph", content: "Why? A few reasons... First, I enjoy the easy synt...">, #<Node id: 10, chapter_id: 1, node_type: "paragraph", content: "There's also the small detail that I'm embarking o...">, ...]
```

### Slim Controller

We can now update the controller action.  Rename your controller from `books` to `nodes` to account for its new focus.  (Don't forget to update your routes and file names as well to account for this renamed controller.)

``` ruby(/api/app/controllers/api/nodes_controller.rb)
class Api::NodesController < ApplicationController
  def index
+     payload = Node.all.fsa
+     render json: payload, status: 200
  end
end
```

``` ruby(/api/config/routes.rb)
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  namespace :api do
+     get 'nodes/', to: "nodes#index"
  end
  # For details on the DSL available within this file,
  # see http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html
end
```

Inside the updated `nodes_controller` our `fsa` scope limits the data provided to our client.  Notice that we're now calling our render method with the JSON key.  This key helps us by automatically converting our payload of nodes into an array of objects (a format which is very easy for our client to digest).

I favor this approach because our scope supplies us a centralized location to update the content of our Flux actions.  As we build future iterations, if we need to expand our Node's provided attributes, updating this scope does so across our entire application.

## Wrapping Up

Reworking our API routes has caused some client-side breakages we must address next chapter.  That aside, let's review the progress we've made.

In this chapter we:
* Migrated our book importer into a Rake Task
* Setup our first database tables and associations
* Transformed our controller action to be ready for use in Flux Standard actions (FSA)

We are going to stop there and turn to our client in the next chapter.  In Chapter 5 we setup Redux to serve as our client-side data store and create our first actions to load data from our API.

Now, let's into dig into Redux!
