# Chapter 4: Organizing Data

As we move forward with our next iteration I am going to be splitting our next phase of work into two chapters; the first dealing with our API changes, and then chapter 4 looks at the matching React changes. 

My first draft of this chapter had all of this arranged into a single chapter, but the result was unmanageable.  We have a significant amount of foundation we need to lay.  To have an iteration that enacts a meaningful change we need to take a more substantial step forward on each side of our application than we have done in previous chapters.  

With that said, let's look at our API.

## All Content is Not Created Equal

Now that we have the foundations of both our client and API established, and a communication channel proved out between them, it is time to start planning.  We are reading the bulk contents of our chapter files, but markdown hides nuance in its text.  Our chapters consist of blocks of text, code, lists, and headings, table, images, links, etc.  Our app is utterly blind to all of that.

Moreover, we have a document taxonomy we have to honor.  A book is not just a collection of random elements; we have an organizational structure we need to preserve; grouping our content into chapters, sections, and paragraphs.

The way we store our information is going to have implications about how we can leverage it.  So it pays to be thoughtful up front when the costs of change are at their lowest.

There are also our applications intended features to consider. What if we wanted to generate an index, or table of contents? If we add search, will we treat all content the same?  Perhaps we should distinguish between searches in our book's main text and its code examples.  If a user wants to save their position and come back to it later, how do we know where they last read?  Can we create a link to specific content and send it to someone in an email, IM, or text?

These features have implications to consider for the way we organize our data.  Whether that is in database tables for our API to draw from or our client-side data store.

## What's on (in) the Table?

Let's think about the problem from the Rails side of things first.  

Concerning our tables, I am inclined to think of a book as being made up of only its high-level parts: the book itself, chapters, sections, and blocks of text.  Its unlikely we would need separate tables to distinguish between blocks of code, and blocks of text for example.  

Since we are only displaying one book, having a table to store that information seems overkill.  Chapters seem like a logical division, as do sections and blocks. 

In our case, chapters are made up of the individual MD files we parse.  Sections I think might be dictated by our Heading blocks (H1 - H6, or perhaps only a subset of those).  Blocks make up all the other items that fall under those sections, as well as the sections themselves, as they are elements of readable content.

Now let's consider the relationships between our elements: 
* A book has many chapters
    * A Chapter Belongs to a book
    * A Chapter has many sections
        * A section belongs to a chapter
        * A section can belong to a larger section
        * A section  can have many sections
        * A section has many blocks
            * A block belongs to a section

Just looking at those relationships, it is clear the most complicated relationship we have in front of us is the sections.  Because headings are commonly nested one inside the other, in the taxonomy of a document, we need a way to represent that owns-many-self relationship.  Creating models in Rails where a relation can both own and be owned by its siblings can get complicated quickly.  In theory, we could look at each section level as a separate table, but that is going to quickly lead to us duplicating code across many more models and tables.

All in all, this is a bigger bite then I am comfortable with for one iteration.  So, let's pick our battles, and find a more straightforward spec.

* A Chapter has many sections
    * A block belongs to a section

We are abandoning the representation of books and sections entirely.  My first instinct was to tackle a watered-down implementation of sections in our first pass.  However, even that seems like too much.  Even keeping our data taxonomy limited to chapters and blocks, we still have a long to-do list of API changes.

There's also a decent chance that as we start to develop, we could decide that more complicated spec is wrong.  It feels right now, but the way we implement our client could lead us in a direction we just can't predict right now.  Better to start with a small bite, one we are sure moves us in a productive direction.

Here's our plan for this iteration:
* Create tables for our new models
* Define relationships
* Change the import of our book from a controller action to a runnable task
* Modify our controller action to pass a JSON response ready for our client.

## Setting Up Tables

Let's start by getting some tables set up.  I prefer to do this (for initial migrations), using Rail's model generators, as they give us both a migration for our database, and a Class in our `models/` directory we can modify.

Let's try not to boil the ocean, and keep our stored data simple.  Run the following generator commands in your terminal from the API directory of your application.

``` bash
rails generate model Chapter title:string
rails generate model Block chapter_id:integer type:string content:text
bin/rails db:migrate
```

Let's also go ahead and define our relationships in our models.

``` ruby(/reactive-api/app/models/chapter.rb)
class Chapter < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :blocks
end
```

``` ruby(/reactive-api/app/models/block.rb)
class Block < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :chapter
end
```

Pretty simple; now we can turn our attention to updating the way that we load content.

## Creating a Task

We admitted when we set up our `book#index` action that we were committing some sins.

Our controller action has no business running a parse/read of our book content.   It is hugely inefficient to have that parse redone every time the action is triggered when the content attached to the action never changes.  Now is our chance to clean that up.  We are going to set up a rake task we can run when we need to load or update our book tables.

Rails provides a generator we can use to produce rake tasks.  That generator takes the form: `rails generate task [namespace] [action] [action]`

Try it out running the following in your terminal.

``` bash
`rails generate task rr load_book clear_book`
```

This sets up two tasks:
`bin/rails rr:load_book`
`bin/rails rr:clear_book`

Notice if you open the generated tasks, that both depend on the `:environment` task.  This dependency makes the full environment of our Rails application available to us inside our tasks.  Now we can start moving the importer classes we set up in our last chapter into these tasks, modifying them to load our database tables as we go.

``` ruby(/reactive-api/lib/loader/book_file_finder.rb)
class BookFileFinder
  attr_reader :entries
  
  def initialize(path)
     @path = normalize_folder(path) 
+     @entries = validate_chapters
  end
  
  private
-     def normalize_folder(path)
-       path[-1] == "/" ? path : path + "/"
-     end
    
-     def locate_chapter_files
-        raw_file_list = expand_file_paths(Dir.entries(@path))
-        filter_chapter_files(raw_file_list);
-     end

+ def validate_chapters
+   all_entries = locate_chapter_files.sort!
+   all_entries.delete_if do |file|
+     load_or_invalidate_chapter(file)
+   end
+ end
      
+ def load_or_invalidate_chapter(file)
+   invalid =  true
+   md_doc = CommonMarker.render_doc(File.read(file))
+   md_doc.each do |node|
+     if node.type == :header
+       invalid = false
+       Chapter.create(title: node.to_commonmark)
+       break
+     end
+   end
        
+   return invalid
+ end
    
-     def filter_chapter_files(raw_file_list)
-         raw_file_list.select do |file|
-             File.file?(file) && File.extname(file) == ".md" && !/readme\.md/i.match?(file)
-         end
-     end
    
-     def expand_file_paths(file_array)
-       file_array.map do |file|
-         @path + file
-       end
-     end
end
```

Look at our updated `BookFileFinder` class.  First, we are going to find this file a new home and move it to `lib/loader/book_file_finder.rb`, along with our 2nd file `book_file_parser.rb`.  Storing these classes in `controllers/concerns/` was always temporary.  Now that we are tying them to a rake task, they can settle into their final destination in the `lib/` directory.

We are setting some basic business rules up around our Chapters before we do a database import.  We are going to require that a file has at least 1 valid heading tag to be considered valid chapter. Moreover, we use the content of the first heading we find as the title for that chapter.

We pass all the files of our book through a new validate chapter method before returning entries.  That validate function runs a loop of all our files.  Using the `delete_if` enumerator, we remove any element from our entries Array that doesn't contain at least one heading node in the document's text.  When we find a valid chapter title, we create a new database record and break from our loop of the book's nodes.

Now let's turn to writing our Rake task.

``` ruby(/reactive-api/lib/tasks/rr.rake)
require "#{Rails.root}/lib/loader/book_file_finder"

namespace :rr do
  desc "Import content at lib/reactivating-rails/"
  task load_book: :environment do
    puts "Loading book content..."
    entries = BookFileFinder.new("#{Rails.root}/lib/reactivating-rails")
    
  end

  desc "Clear content of previously loaded iterations"
  task clear_book: :environment do
    puts "Clearing book content..."
  end
end
```

For a start, we are calling our file finder with our book directory.  Go ahead and run the task using the following terminal command: `bin/rails rr:load_book`

Not much to see now, but if we open a console session (`bin/rails console`), we can pull the last chapter title imported (`Chapter.last`).  You should see something like:

`id: 9, title: "Chapter 2: Loading and Displaying Basic Content\n", created_at: "2017-08-30 01:59:40", updated_at: "2017-08-30 01:59:40"`

Not bad, but we are not getting much feedback from our rake task as it does its work.  Personally, I prefer some reporting from my console so that if something goes haywire, something indicates where I should start digging.  I also think we are overreaching in our `BookFileFinder` class now.  The validation of a chapter is not an easy read, and that is probably a sign we are doing too much in one class.

Let's move the Chapter validation into a class of its own:

``` ruby(/reactive-api/lib/loader/chapter_file.rb)
class ChapterFile
  attr_reader :title, :body, :record
  
  def initialize(file)
    @file_path = file
    @body = CommonMarker.render_doc(File.read(file))
  end
  
  public
    def save
      unless self.invalid?
        puts "Creating chapter: #{@record.title}"
        @record.save
      end
    end
    
    def invalid?
      @body.each do |node|
        if node.type == :header
          @record = Chapter.new(title: node.to_plaintext.strip)
          return false
        end
      end
      puts "#{@file_path} removed as invalid chapter; ensure file has at least one heading."
      return true
    end
end
```

We are going to set up two public methods for this class: `save` and `invalid`.  These methods encapsulate the two main jobs we want this Class to perform for us.  First, we need a way to remove any Chapter files that don't meet our spec of having a required title/heading.  So our `invalid?` method traverses the node map of the markdown document, setting up an unsaved model instance upon finding a heading suitable as a title.  If no heading nodes are present, the method returns true.

We split the `save` logic into its own method so that we can be deliberate about when that save happens in the context of our larger Rake task.

We're also using several attribute readers so that we have an interface to several levels of our markdown chapter:
* `:body`, which contains the full text of the markdown
* `:title`, to store our assigned title.
* And `:record`, which stores our Active Record model instance.  
 
The record attribute is helpful when we want to start importing blocks of chapter text.  With the record in hand for each Chapter instance, we can use method chaining such as `chapter.block.create`, rather than passing IDs around when creating our blocks. 

Now we can update our Rake task to use this new class.

``` ruby(/reactive-api/lib/tasks/rr.rake)
task load_book: :environment do
    puts "Loading book content..."
    entries = BookFileFinder.new("#{Rails.root}/lib/reactivating-rails").entries
    
    entries.delete_if do |file|
      ChapterFile.new(file).invalid?
    end
    
    entries.each do |file|
      chapter = ChapterFile.new(file)
      chapter.save
    end
  end
```

We are splitting up our work with the `ChapterFiles` class into two steps; or iterations through the collection:  
 1. Using `delete_if`, we pull out any chapter instances that are invalid.
 2. Then we pass through the remaining array again to save the remaining files.

This configuration is not the most efficient way to do this, as we end up running our validation pass twice for the valid chapters.  However, the tradeoff is that we end up with clean, readable ruby in our task.  I am willing to make that trade in a task designed to run so infrequently.

Now, we can pull out our Chapter validation from the `BookFileFinder` class.

``` ruby(/reactive-api/lib/loader/book_file_finder.rb)
class BookFileFinder
  attr_reader :entries
  
  def initialize(path)
     @path = normalize_folder(path) 
     @entries = locate_chapter_files.sort_by! {|x| File.basename(x,".md").to_i}
  end
  
  private
    def normalize_folder(path)
      path[-1] == "/" ? path : path + "/"
    end
    
    def locate_chapter_files
       raw_file_list = expand_file_paths(Dir.entries(@path))
       filter_chapter_files(raw_file_list);
    end
    
    def filter_chapter_files(raw_file_list)
        raw_file_list.select do |file|
            File.file?(file) && File.extname(file) == ".md" && !/readme\.md/i.match?(file)
        end
    end
    
    def expand_file_paths(file_array)
      #Array.map allows us to iterate through the array
      # Here we update each member by concatenating the directory path onto the file name
      file_array.map do |file|
        @path + file
      end
    end
end
```
Let's check in and run our rake task, `bin/rails rr:load_book`

``` bash
Creating chapter: Chapter 0: Introduction
Creating chapter: Chapter 1: Installing React and Rails
Creating chapter: Chapter 2: Loading and Displaying Basic Content
```

If you check out your database in the Rails console, you should also see a Chapter record created for each chapter file.

With that behind us, the next step for us to tackle is parsing our blocks.  Seeing as we already have instances of our Chapters being looped through while we do our `chapter.save` call, our work should be trivial.

``` ruby(/reactive-api/lib/tasks/rr.rake)
task load_book: :environment do
  puts "Loading book content..."
  entries = BookFileFinder.new("#{Rails.root}/lib/reactivating-rails").entries
  
  entries.delete_if do |file|
    ChapterFile.new(file).invalid?
  end
  
  entries.each do |file|
    chapter = ChapterFile.new(file)
    chapter.save
    
+     chapter.body.each do |node|
+       chapter.record.blocks.create(type: node.type.to_s, content: node.to_commonmark)
+     end
  end
end
```

However, check in and execute your migration again, and we see a problem.  It seems I stumbled into a reserved word for Model attributes when I selected `type` as a column name.  We are going to have to change that before we move forward.  While we are running a migration anyhow, it has also been bothering me that I chose the model name `Blocks`, while our `CommonMarker` gem refers to this same element as a `node`.  I think we would benefit by unifying around one term, so I am going to use this opportunity to rename our table as well.

`bin/rails generate migration rename_table_block_as_node`

``` ruby(/reactive-api/db/migrate/[stamp]_rename_table_block_as_node.rb)
class RenameTableBlockAsNode < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.1]
  def change
    rename_table :blocks, :nodes
    rename_column :nodes, :type, :node_type
  end
end
```

Run the migration (`bin/rails db:migrate`), and then be sure to update your `Blocks` model name, file name, spec name, and association in the `Chapters` model (to `has_many :nodes`).

Finally, update your rake task:

``` ruby
task load_book: :environment do
  puts "Loading book content..."
  entries = BookFileFinder.new("#{Rails.root}/lib/reactivating-rails").entries
  
  entries.delete_if do |file|
    ChapterFile.new(file).invalid?
  end
  
  entries.each do |file|
    chapter = ChapterFile.new(file)
    chapter.save
    
    chapter.body.each do |node|
+       chapter.record.nodes.create(node_type: node.type.to_s, content: node.to_commonmark)
    end
  end
end
```

Execute your task again, and then open an IRB console.  You should now see populated `Node` and `Chapter` tables. We may eventually need to split the Node parsing logic off into its own class as well, but this early implementation is sufficient until our needs evolve.

I am also going to put a pin in the other rake task we generated, `rr:clear_book`.  Right now, we can skimp by using the default task Rails gives us `bin/rails db:reset`, which clears all our tables, and reset our indexes to zero.  In the future, as we add other models we might not want to purge the entire database every time we load an updated copy of the book.  For now, this meets our needs.  In fact, if you have run the `rr:load_book` task a few times this iteration, you might want to run `db:reset` and then `rr:load_book` before moving forward to ensure you have clean data.

## Testing Our Importer

Before we move on, let's make a few brush-up changes to our test suite.

For the moment, our suite should be valid.  However, we added a new business rule for chapter creation we should be sure we have tests to cover.  Let's add a new document to our `testbook/` directory we set up in our last chapter.  Name the file `invalidChapter.md`, and put a bit of sample text inside:


``` markdown(/reactive-api/spec/lib/testbook/invalidChapter.md)
This sample file is invalid as it contains no valid headings to serve as the chapter title.

It will test true on Chapter.invalid?
```

I'm also going to move my `book_file_finder_spec.rb` and `book_file_parse_spec.rb` files, along with their associated `testbook/` directory into a `spec/lib/` folder so that they mirror the new layout of our app directory.  If we rerun the spec now, we get a failure on our test `BookFileFinder removes readme.md, directories, and non-md files from return`, the reason for this failure is that our file finder only concerns itself with the initial validation of the file as an MD document, and ensuring that the file is not a directory or README.md.

You need to make some corrections to account for your new files, and paths as well.  Go ahead and update each spec as follows:

``` ruby(/reactive-api/spec/lib/book_file_finder_spec.rb)
require 'rails_helper'
require 'loader/book_file_finder'

RSpec.describe BookFileFinder do
  it "removes readme.md, directories, and non-md files from return" do
+     path = "spec/lib/testbook/"
    entries = BookFileFinder.new(path).entries
+     expect(entries.length).to eq 2
    expect(entries[0]).to eq path+"mockChapter.md"
  end
  
  it "enforces proper file path" do
+     path = "spec/lib/testbook/"
+     bad_path = "spec/lib/testbook"
    expect(BookFileFinder.new(path).entries).to eq BookFileFinder.new(bad_path).entries
  end
end
```

``` ruby(/reactive-api/spec/lib/book_file_parse_spec.rb)
require 'rails_helper'
require 'loader/book_file_parser'

RSpec.describe BookFileParser do
  it "creates payload of top level blocks from array of MD files" do
+     payload = BookFileParser.new(["spec/lib/testbook/mockChapter.md"]).payload
    expect(payload.length).to eq 13
  end
end
```

Now we are green on our tests, except the pending tests we have for our generated models.  Leave these stubs as a reminder for now, but I do not see a need to test the minimalist implementation we have there at the moment.

However, let's add a test suite for our chapter parser.

``` ruby(/reactive-api/spec/lib/chapter_file_spec.rb)
require 'rails_helper'
require 'loader/chapter_file.rb'

RSpec.describe ChapterFile do
  it "invalidates chapters without titles/headings" do
    chapter_test = ChapterFile.new("spec/lib/testbook/invalidChapter.md").invalid?
    expect(chapter_test).to be_truthy
  end
  
  describe "valid chapters" do
    before(:each) do
      @chapter = chapter = ChapterFile.new("spec/lib/testbook/mockChapter.md")
    end
    
    it "have headings/titles" do
      expect(@chapter.invalid?).to be_falsey
    end
    
    it "create model instances when saved." do
      @chapter.save
      expect(Chapter.all.count).to eq(1)
    end
  end
end
```

Rerun your test suite, and you should have a passing run.  We have some gaps left, particularly around our Rake task itself.  Though, for now, I think we can get by testing the task's underlying parts.  

With our rake task in place, let's update our controller action to prepare it for working with our client-side data store (Redux).

## Fluxifying your Controller Actions

We need to put the cart before the horse for a minute and talk about Flux.

If you are not familiar, Flux is the data pattern underlying Redux.  In the simplest terms I can manage, Flux is a principle of unidirectional data flow.  Redux enforces this pattern by encapsulating all state changes in instructions that get passed to our data store called Flux Standard Actions (FSA), or usually just "actions" for short.

An action is a simple JSON object that contains a type attribute, which tells our store what needs to happen.  Actions also contain a payload of other information the store needs to accomplish the requested state change.  For example, `{type: "SOME_KEY", payload: {data: "stuff"}}`

These actions pass through our reducers, which are specialized functions in our store that update the state.  
1. An action gets dispatched to the store.  
2. The store checks to see if it knows how to respond to the action key specified in the `type` attribute of the action.
  * If it does, the reducer creates a new state object for the store.
  * If it does not, the reducer returns the current unaltered state

Down the chain in React, our components are subscribed to the store,  listening for changes in the state.  When the state changes, the components are rendered again against this new state, and the screen redraws accordingly.

Our components might render interfaces that dispatch additional actions.  For example, submitting a login form might dispatch a `REQUEST_SESSION` action.  That action might get picked up by middleware (more on that later), that sends that a username and password to our API, which checks if it is a valid sign-on attempt.  If it is, it might then send back another action to our client, such as `CREATE_SESSION`, and send a payload; perhaps containing a display name for the user, a token for the authentication, expiration, and data about the user.  Then that action would make its way to our reducer, which would update the user state.  This new state might trigger our navigation bar to redraw, and we might see a login form disappear, replaced by a user welcome message.

What we will not (should not) see is a component reaching directly into the store to modify the state.  Our components, our API, our web sockets, all should dispatch actions.  Our store, and more specifically our Reducers, decides how these actions influence our state and push out updates as needed.

All that is to say, our controller actions should follow this pattern, and push back data easily composed into actions for our store.

We're close already, but there are a few things we can do to make this easier.

## Scoping our Model data

First, let's create a scope in our model that we can use to limit our queries to the fields we want to be available in our client-side store.  Rails automatically creates some columns as part of its defaults that we just don't need to have available in our client store.  Fields such as `created_at`, and `updated_at` don't have much to offer our store, at least in this application.

We can also use Active Record to enforce some conventions for us like ordering of elements.  It would be nice if we knew our components could pick up our store's state and have the elements ordered in a way that's ready to use.  We might still reinforce this order on the client as well in cases where it is critical.   The Active Record query interface makes ordering so easy though; it seems a shame not to take advantage.

Let's open our node models and add a scope.

``` ruby 
- # == Schema Information
- #
- # Table name: nodes
- #
- #  id         :integer          not null, primary key
- #  chapter_id :integer
- #  node_type  :string
- #  content    :text
- #  created_at :datetime         not null
- #  updated_at :datetime         not null
- #

class Node < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :chapter
  
+   scope :fsa, -> { order(chapter_id: :asc, id: :asc ).select(:id, :chapter_id, :node_type, :content) }
end
```

We are creating a scope called `:fsa` for our model that formats our returned entries, so they are prepared to place into our Actions.  First enforcing our content order: chapters first, and then the nodes within.  Then limiting the columns to only those, we want in our store.

Open the console, and try it out by running `Nodes.all.fsa`.  You should get back a response like the following:

``` bash
[#<Node id: 6, chapter_id: 1, node_type: "paragraph", content: "I'm also hoping this exercise will help me develop...">, #<Node id: 7, chapter_id: 1, node_type: "header", content: "## So, what are we building?\n">, #<Node id: 8, chapter_id: 1, node_type: "paragraph", content: "Together (In a non-linear timey-wimey sense), we a...">, #<Node id: 9, chapter_id: 1, node_type: "paragraph", content: "Why? A few reasons... First, I enjoy the easy synt...">, #<Node id: 10, chapter_id: 1, node_type: "paragraph", content: "There's also the small detail that I'm embarking o...">, ...]
```

Now let's update our controller action to use this setup, and rename our controller from `book` to `nodes` to account for the now more detailed focus.  (Don't forget to update your routes and file names as well to account for this renamed controller.)

``` ruby(/reactive-api/app/controllers/api/nodes_controller.rb)
class Api::NodesController < ApplicationController
  def index
+     payload = Node.all.fsa
+     render json: payload, status: 200
  end
end
```

Now we are using our `fsa` scope to prepare our active record associations for use in our Flux actions.  The scope handles ordering for us and sets limitations on passing columns we want to our client.  The last step in preparation is calling our render method with the JSON key.  This key helps us by automatically converting our payload of nodes into an array of objects (a format which as you will see in the next chapter, is very easy for our client to digest).

I favor this approach because our scope supplies us with a centralized location where we can update the content of our Flux actions.  Right now, the benefit is less apparent, because we only have the one action that relies on this model.  However, as we add actions, if we decide somewhere downstream we need to expand this element's attributes in our client-side scope (such as when we add a section ID), we can quickly update the scope to have this change reflected in all our controller actions.  

## Wrapping Up

We are going to stop there and turn to our client application in our next chapter.  You will notice we have not addressed our Chapter's model yet; we will be coming back to that as we move forward.  

This chapter we have:
* Migrated our book importer into a Rake Task
* Setup our first database tables and associations
* Transformed our controller action to be ready for use in Flux Standard actions (FSA)

Now, we get to dig into Redux!

## Author's Aside

I struggled when writing this chapter on how to set up our controller responses.  In some projects, I have favored setting up my controllers to pass back fully built out actions when called, rather than just a raw information payload.

This distinction in responses would be the difference between passing `{type: SOME_ACTION, payload: [array, of, nodes]}` vs. a simple `[array, of, nodes]`.  I went back and forth several times before settling on passing only the action payload.  

There are pros and cons of both approaches.  Passing just the raw payload leaves our endpoints more client-agnostic.  We deliver information with the API, and leave it to the digesting application to decide what do with that information.

However, I do find that this approach leads to an application structure that relies on more small API calls and fewer composite endpoints.  For example, in this chapter we renamed our `book` controller, to `nodes` as the endpoint now passes only one component that makes up our book.  Presumably, we now need endpoints for the other data types as well; chapters, sections, and so on.  To fetch all of that information we now need to query several endpoints.

However, there's nothing that stops us from setting up a composite endpoint that passes back all of our information in one pass.  I have in the past relied on middleware to solve this problem.  I've defined a sever-action middleware in Redux, that takes an action, whose payload is itself several actions, such as: `{type: "SERVER_PAYLOAD", actions: [{type: "SOME_FSA"}, {type: "ANOTHER FSA"}]}`.  A middleware listening for the "SERVER_PAYLOAD" type intercepts this action before it reaches our reducers, and splits the action payload; dispatching each action to the store.  Using this format, we could create a single `book` endpoint, that loads ALL the information that make up our book content.

Using middleware this way is a nice way to bundle multiple client-side actions into a single response from our API.  There are drawbacks though.  It becomes more complicated for applications to digest our API, as they need to parse out this bundle of actions into a usable form.  Error handling also becomes more opaque, because we have several outcomes bundled into one request.  And testing similarly becomes more complicated, as we try to test several expectations for a single endpoint.

There's room to negotiate on how much lifting you ask your API to do, vs. what you lean on the client to do.  In this book, I have chosen to pass raw data from our API endpoints, because it provides the purest implementation I can manage in both the client and the API.  However, it is worth noting there's more than one way to get the job done.  I encourage you to experiment with your projects and find a convention that works best for you.
