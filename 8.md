# Chapter 8: High Order Components
This chapter we'll be doing a refactor of some of our container components with an eye on making them more reusable.  To do this we'll be transforming our container for chapters into a High Order Component so that we can reuse the connection to our chapter state across several components.

We'll also establish a new container for an `alerts` state, which we'll use to establish some early error handling in our client.

## Jumping in Here

If you haven't been following along with code examples and want to jump in here, you can use our [Chapter8Starter](https://github.com/swachtma/reactivating-rails-app/tree/Chapter8Starter) branch as a place to join in.

## Composing Components (HOCS)

One area that has been troubling me with our design is our `ChapterMenuItems` component.  I still dislike that our component, which is almost entirely logic free, is still in charge of checking if an `active_chapter` is defined before rendering.  I'd like this check moved into our container so that all of our store logic is contained there.

I've also been thinking that the footer of each of our chapters should really have a link to the next chapter.  That way a reader doesn't need to use the drop-down menu to simply advance one chapter as they read.  The requirements of such a link component are going to be very similar to the larger `ChapterMenuItems` component, so it would be nice if they could share a connection to the store.

To do this, I'm going to change my container so that it composes a new component with a function, and use that function to perform the logic tests related to rendering.  If the container can provide everything we need for the render, our composed component will render a child element (our final component) and pass along the props needed.

Components constructed by functions this way, are given the name High Order Components.  Although in my experience they often contain connections to our Redux store, so referring to them as “High Order Containers” might also be accurate.
## Composing our first High Order Component

Let’s begin our refactor of on chapter’s container and we can talk through the modifications as we move along.  I'm going to rename our file `controlled_chapter_menu_items.js` to `chapters_provider.js` to better reflect its new use, I suggest you do the same.

``` javascript
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import React from 'react';

import ChapterMenuItems from '../components/chapter_menu_items';
import { routeChapter } from '../actions/routes';

export const connectToChapters = (WrappedComponent) => {
   return connect(mapStateToProps,mapDispatchToProps)(chapterProvider(WrappedComponent));
};

const chapterProvider = (WrappedComponent) => {
  return class extends React.Component {
    render(){
      if(this.props.chapters !== [] && this.props.active_chapter){
        return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} />;
        
      } else {
        return null;
      }
    }
  };
};

const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
  active_chapter: state.chapters.find(
   (chapter) => chapter.id === state.settings.active_chapter_id
  ),
  chapters: state.chapters
});

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => ({
  dispatchRouteChapter: (event,target) => dispatch(routeChapter(target.value))
});

// EXPORTABLE CONNECTED COMPONENTS
export const ConnectedChapterMenuItems = connectToChapters(ChapterMenuItems);
```

High Orders Components (HOCs) are functions which return new React components, and they are very useful for sharing logic among several different components.

Let's start with what's familiar, our connect function.  We've changed our use of connect to now call a function `chapterProvider(WrappedComponent)` instead of a component.  We know that connect expects to be passed a component though, so that gives us our first big clue about just what `chapterProvider` is doing.

Step inside the chapterProvider function and you'll see it immediately calls a return (though this is not required).  That return is going to construct a new React component for us.  Inside, we're setting up a new component almost exactly as we have seen done in the past.  We've moved our logic test for the presence of `chapters` and `active_chapter` inside this newly constructed component.

Our HOC will rely on the fact that it's going to be called through connect to receive the props `chapters` and `active_chapter`.  It will perform a test, to see that both values are available; if not, it will simply return `null` when the component render.  If the props are available, then it will take the given `WrappedComponent` parameter, and return that as it's render value.  We use `{...this.props} to ensure that any props given to our HOC, get passed through to the rendered component.  This is a necessary step because our function sends back the anonymous constructed component to `connect`.  That means that anonymous component is where our props will land after being provided by our store.  We’re using the spread operator to ensure all ours props are passed through to the final component we are trying to render.

This sets our HOC up as the perfect place to perform testing to ensure that we are ready to render.  And since it's housed inside a function, we can reuse this logical test easily to render other components dependent on our chapter’s information.  All we need to do is pass through a different component.

Finally, we create a new exportable value `ConnectedChapterMenuItems`, which provides our `ChapterMenuItems` component to `connectToChapters`, and returns our connected component.  It's worth noting that you could also export `connectToChapters` where you plan to use the connected component (in our case this would be inside `MenuBar`).  But I prefer to set it up here as an exportable, so that as my list of component using this HOC grows, I have them all assembled in one place.

Now we can make some updates to `ChapterMenuItems` to remove the rendering logic we no longer need.

``` javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Dropdown } from 'semantic-ui-react';

export default class ChapterMenuItems extends Component {
  renderChapterOptions = () => {
    let chapters_list = [];
    this.props.chapters.forEach((chapter) => {
      chapters_list.push(
        { 
          key: "chapter_" + chapter.id,
          id:  "chapter_menu_item_" + chapter.id,
          value: chapter.id,
          text: chapter.title,
          active: chapter.id === this.props.active_chapter.id
        }
      );
    });
    return chapters_list;
  }
  
  render() {
    return( 
        <Dropdown 
          tabIndex="1"
          placeholder="Jump to Chapter..."
          className="link item"
          selectOnNavigation={false}
          value={this.props.active_chapter.id}
          text={this.props.active_chapter.title}
          onChange={this.props.dispatchRouteChapter}
          options={this.renderChapterOptions()} 
        />
      );
  }
}
```

And we’ll also need to update `MenuBar` to use our new `ConnectedChapterMenuItems` component.

``` Javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Container, Image, Menu } from 'semantic-ui-react';
import reactLogo from '../assets/images/react-logo.svg';
import railsLogo from '../assets/images/rails-logo.svg';

import { ConnectedChapterMenuItems } from '../containers/chapter_provider';

const fixedMenuStyle = {
  backgroundColor: '#fff',
  border: '1px solid #ddd',
  boxShadow: '0px 3px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)',
  paddingTop: "13px",
  paddingBottom: "13px"
};

const tightItem = {
  paddingTop: "0",
  paddingBottom: "0"
}

class MenuBar extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
        <Menu
          id="menu_bar"
          borderless
          stackable
          fixed="top"
          style={ fixedMenuStyle }
        >
          <Container textAlign="center">
            <Menu.Item className="banner" style={tightItem}>
              <Image size='mini' src={reactLogo} />
              <Image size='mini' src={railsLogo} />
              <Menu.Item header>Reactivating Rails: A work in progress</Menu.Item>
            </Menu.Item>

            <Menu.Menu position='right' style={tightItem} value={this.props.active_chapter}>
              <ConnectedChapterMenuItems />
            </Menu.Menu>
          </Container>
        </Menu>
    );
  }
}

export default MenuBar;
```

## Reusability of High Order Components

Now let's build a footer chapter link to demonstrate the reusability of our new HOC, and improve our UX as well.  First though, when I told you that Redux First Router was modularized, I really wasn't kidding.  In order to create a link using the provided helper we need to install that module: `npm install --save redux-first-router-link`.

Now let's set up the Component first, creating a new file `src/components/chapter_footer.js`

``` javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import Link from 'redux-first-router-link';

import * as routes from '../constants/settings.js';

const chapter_footer_style = {
  margin: "15px 0",
  textAlign: "center",
};

class ChapterFooter extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div id="chapter-footer-link" style={chapter_footer_style}>
        <h2>
          <Link to={{type: routes.CHAPTER_ROUTE, payload: {chapter_id: this.props.active_chapter.id + 1}}}>
            Next Chapter
          </Link>
        </h2>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default ChapterFooter;
```

The `Link` Component from Redux First Route allows us to use several formats to describe our link destinations.  We can provide a route such as `chapter/6`, or a full FSA as seen above.  We can also tie the action to a dispatch function connected to our store, but there is an SEO upside to using one of the first two options as our link will actually contain a route path, rather than tying the action to an onClick handler.

I prefer the FSA route, because if our paths change, we can update our action creators, and avoid needing to change links in a slew of places.  We are hard writing the FSA into our component for now as an example, but we'll change to an action creator in a moment.

Now we need to connect this component through our provider.

``` javascript
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import React from 'react';

import ChapterMenuItems from '../components/chapter_menu_items';
import ChapterFooter from '../components/chapter_footer';
import { routeChapter } from '../actions/routes';

export const connectToChapters = (WrappedComponent) => {
   return connect(mapStateToProps,mapDispatchToProps)(chapterProvider(WrappedComponent));
};

const chapterProvider = (WrappedComponent) => {
  return class extends React.Component {
    render(){
      if(this.props.chapters !== [] && this.props.active_chapter){
        return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} />;
        
      } else {
        return null;
      }
    }
  };
};

const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
  active_chapter: state.chapters.find(
   (chapter) => chapter.id === state.settings.active_chapter_id
  ),
  chapters: state.chapters
});

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => ({
  dispatchRouteChapter: (event,target) => dispatch(routeChapter(target.value))
});

// EXPORTABLE CONNECTED COMPONENTS
export const ConnectedChapterMenuItems = connectToChapters(ChapterMenuItems);
export const ConnectedChapterFooterLink = connectToChapters(ChapterFooter);
```

And now we can use this new exportable inside our `ReaderPane`.  (Note: I'm also updating our styles on this component a bit.)

``` javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Container } from 'semantic-ui-react';
import { ConnectedChapterFooterLink } from '../containers/chapter_provider';

const reader_pane_styles= {
  paddingBottom: "15px"
};

class ReaderPane extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div id="reader-pane" style={ reader_pane_styles }>
        <Container text>
        { this.props.children }
        <ConnectedChapterFooterLink />
        </Container>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default ReaderPane;
```

Let's go ahead and take a look at this first simple pass.

![Simple Footer Link](/images/8/SimpleFooterLink.png)


## Extensibility of High Order Components

Our footer link is OK for a first pass, but I think it would be better to actually give the title of the next chapter in the link text, rather than a simple "Next" message.  Also, when we reach the end of the book we need to not advertise a link for moving on to a chapter that doesn't exist…

Let's add some additional props to our container so we can make these extensions.

``` javascript
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import React from 'react';

import ChapterMenuItems from '../components/chapter_menu_items';
import ChapterFooter from '../components/chapter_footer';
import { routeChapter } from '../actions/routes';

export const connectToChapters = (WrappedComponent) => {
   return connect(mapStateToProps,mapDispatchToProps)(chapterProvider(WrappedComponent));
};

const chapterProvider = (WrappedComponent) => {
  return class extends React.Component {
    render(){
      if(this.props.chapters !== [] && this.props.active_chapter){
        return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} />;
        
      } else {
        return null;
      }
    }
  };
};

const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
  active_chapter: state.chapters.find(
   (chapter) => chapter.id === state.settings.active_chapter_id
  ),
  
  next_chapter: state.chapters.find(
  (chapter) => chapter.id === state.settings.active_chapter_id + 1
  ),
  
  chapters: state.chapters
});

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => ({
  dispatchRouteChapter: (event,target) => dispatch(routeChapter(target.value))
});

// EXPORTABLE CONNECTED COMPONENTS
export const ConnectedChapterMenuItems = connectToChapters(ChapterMenuItems);
export const ConnectedChapterFooterLink = connectToChapters(ChapterFooter);
```

We'll set up `next_chapter` much the same way we did `active_chapter`.  We'll pass a complete chapter object, rather than a simple ID, this way we have the title available should we need it. 

Now let's update our ChapterFooter component to make use of this new prop.

```(javascript)
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import Link from 'redux-first-router-link';

import * as actions from '../actions/routes.js';

const chapter_footer_style = {
  margin: "30px 0",
  textAlign: "center",
};

class ChapterFooter extends Component {
  
  renderLinkOrThanks = (next_chapter) => {
    let thanks = "The End - Thank you for Reading!";
    return next_chapter ? 
      <Link to={actions.routeChapter(next_chapter.id)}>Next - {next_chapter.title}</Link> : thanks;
  }
  
  render() {
    return (
      <div id="chapter-footer-link" style={chapter_footer_style}>
        <h2>
          { this.renderLinkOrThanks(this.props.next_chapter) }
        </h2>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default ChapterFooter;
```

We've made a couple of changes here.  First, we're now using our action creator function for our routes inside the `Link` component. 

We've also added a new method to the component `renderLinkOrThanks` which will check whether a `next_chapter` prop is available, and then either print out our `Link`, or a thank you message to our readers (because I really do appreciate you choosing to read this, and I hope the text serves you well).

We could have done this data selection for `next_chapter` inside of our footer component to the same result.  But doing it in our container makes that logic available to all of our connected components.  Even if we don’t use all the props given by our provider in every component I still prefer to have my data selection/filtering done inside a central location.  I find myself thinking of containers much the same way I do my Active Record models; you could perform your data operation in a view, but you probably shouldn’t.

## Handling Errors and Messaging in our Client

We've not done much in the way of error reporting up until this point, and frankly that's because we haven't really needed it.  Right now the only thing I can really see going wrong with our application is a failure to instantiate our book contents.  If instantiation goes off without a problem, the rest of our application should be pretty much bullet proof.

But as we expand our functionality, there will be more and more need to report messages through our client so that the user stays informed of state changes, problems, help hints, etc.  I want to lay the groundwork for this messaging now so that we have it available to use in future iterations when we should be making use of it.

Thinking about what I need from this system, this is what I come up with:
* Not all alerts are negative; I'd like the system to support positive, neutral, and error messages through the same system.
* Alerts should be contextual for the area of the application that triggered them.  (hypothetically if we need to alert about an error with a form the error should appear in/near that element)
* Alerts should be attributed to an "application" area/level by default if a more specific marker is not set.
* Alerts should clear on a route change so they do not linger past when they are valid.

I'm going to define my action creator first in `src/actions/alerts.js`.

``` javascript
import * as constants from "../constants/alerts";

export const addAlert = (message, level = constants.lvls[0], scope = constants.scopes[0]) => ({
  type: constants.ADD_ALERT, payload: {message, level, scope, timestamp: Date.now()}
});

export const clearAlerts = () => ({ type: constants.CLEAR_ALERTS }) ;
```

Our action creators should be becoming second nature at this point.  The only new element in `addAlert` is the use of function default parameters to assign a value to `scope` and `level` if we don't want to specify a different value.  I've also used `Date.now()` to create a timestamp for each alert.  We're likely going to print these as lists to the screen, and React will require a unique `key` property for each element when we print it through a collection.  Since we don't have an Active Record ID available for these alerts, the timestamp will serve.  It will also have the added bonus of allowing us to order alerts chronologically should the need arise.

I'm also defining a set list of value in our constants file which we'll be using in both our action creators and reducer.

``` javascript
export const ADD_ALERT = "ADD_ALERT";
export const CLEAR_ALERTS = "CLEAR_ALERTS";

// Enumerated Values, default array[0] in reducer & actionCreators
export const scopes = ["application"];
export const lvls = ["info","warning","success","danger"];
```

Now we need a reducer connected to our store.  Notice that I am enforcing the default values for our alerts inside the reducer.  When I first wrote this, I confess I actually had our action creator doing this enforcement of our `scope` and `level` enumerated values.  It wasn't until I actually started writing my reducer that it occurred to me that nothing stopped me from dispatching an action directly to the store without using the action creator.  If we really want to enforce a data format on our store, it needs to live inside our reducer.  Thus the `normalizeAlert` function will live here.

``` javascript
import * as constants from '../constants/alerts';
const default_state = [];

export const normalizeAlert = (payload) => {
  payload.scope = constants.scopes.includes(payload.scope) ? payload.scope : constants.scopes[0];
  payload.level = constants.lvls.includes(payload.level) ? payload.level : constants.lvls[0];
  return payload;
};

const alertsReducer = function(state = default_state,action){
  switch (action.type) {
    case(constants.ADD_ALERT):
      return [...state, normalizeAlert(action.payload)]
    case(constants.CLEAR_ALERTS):
      return [];
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

export default alertsReducer;
```

We haven't really seen a case statement pattern  like; `return [...state, normalizeAlert(action.payload)]` in any of our previous reducers.  But this is in my opinion one of the easiest ways to append new items to an array in our state.  We're using the literal syntax, combined with the spread operator; this easily carries over the existing values in our state, as the spread operator applies all the existing members to the new array instance. Then we append the new value to the end after it returns from our `normalizeAlert` function.

The second case for our reducer `CLEAR_ALERTS` simply resets our store to an empty Array.

Don't forget to add this reducer to your `combineReducers` function inside of `store.js` before moving forward.

### Leveraging our Alerts Reducer

Now I want to modify a few of my existing scripts to leverage this new alert structure for error reporting to our users.  Let's start with our instantiate book saga.

``` javascript
import { takeEvery, select, put, call, all } from 'redux-saga/effects';
import axios from 'axios';

import * as routes from '../constants/settings';
import { loadNodes } from '../actions/nodes';
import { loadChapters } from '../actions/chapters';
import { addAlert } from '../actions/alerts';

export const checkBookHydration = (state) => {
    return !(state.chapters.length && state.nodes.length)
  }

export function* instantiateBook(){
  const dehydrated = yield select(checkBookHydration);
  
  if(dehydrated){
    try{
      const [nodes, chapters] = yield all([
        call(axios.get,'/api/node'),
        call(axios.get,'/api/chapters')
      ]);
      
      yield all([
        put(loadNodes(nodes.data)),
        put(loadChapters(chapters.data))
      ]);
    }
    catch(e){
      yield put(addAlert(
        "We were unable to fetch the latest copy of this book at this time. " +
        "Sorry for the inconvenience!  You can try refreshing you browser. " +
        "Or returning to visit another time.",
        "danger"
      ));
    }
  }
} 

window.instantiateBook = instantiateBook;

export function* watchBookRoutesSaga(){
  yield takeEvery([routes.HOME_ROUTE, routes.CHAPTER_ROUTE], instantiateBook);
};
```

We're adding our alert to the catch block of our saga.  Keep in mind we could also return error values from our rails application and log those errors in a similar fashion.  For a more complex action like a login that's probably the method I would take.  In a more complex action, several things might go wrong; our token could be invalid, expired, or have insufficient privileges.  We'd want to give different messages to our users in each of these outcomes to guide them through correcting the problem.

With a fetch from our index actions, we're pretty bulletproof, unless the API is offline, or our routes are corrupted.  In fact, that's exactly what I've done to trigger the error on this saga.  I've temporarily set our fetch of nodes to `call(axios.get,'/api/node')`.

If we allow the application to load now, we'll see our saga dispatch the alert message.

### Creating an Alerts HOC

Now let's set up our container.

``` javascript
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import React from 'react';

import { scopes } from '../constants/alerts';
import AlertList from '../components/alert_list';

const alertProvider = (scope = scopes[0], WrappedComponent = AlertList) => {
  let mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
    alerts: state.alerts.filter((a) => a.scope === scope)
  });
  
  return connect(mapStateToProps,null)(WrappedComponent);
};

export default alertProvider;
```

We're taking a different approach here with this HOC.  It might even be stretching the definition to call this an HOC.  The difference with this example is that we are letting `connect` do the heavy lifting of building our intermediary component inside the factory function.  But we can still use a wrapping function to increase the flexibility of the module exported overall.

Here, we are passing in two parameters to our function.  The first, `scope` we supply with a default value from our constants file where we’ve defined our list of allowed values.  If we don't specify a value for scope we'll default to "application".  However, if we want to use this container again in other more focused areas of our application we might pass "login", or another value.  

The scope value is utilized in our `mapStateToProps` function to ensure the wrapped component only gains access to alerts with the matching scope value.

We're also passing a `WrappedComponent` property, which will default to an `AlertList` component.  We'll use this default to print a list of standard messages to our UI.  But we can also override this component if we need to.  We could for example pass in a login form component, and use a unique scope value to render alerts only about that form, or its elements.  

This approach HOC gives us a lot of flexibility to reuse this connection to our alert state.  And that will encourage us to standardize how we handle these type of messages across our whole application.

### Printing Alerts

Let's go ahead and define the `AlertList` component.

``` javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';

const alertStyle = {
  padding: "15px",
  marginBottom: "20px",
  border: "1px solid transparent",
  borderRadius: "4px"
},

alertLevels = {
  info: {
    backgroundColor: "#d9edf7",
    borderColor: "#bce8f1",
    color: "#31708f"
  },
  warning: {
    backgroundColor: "#fcf8e3",
    borderColor: "#faebcc",
    color: "#8a6d3b"
  },
  success:{
    backgroundColor: "#dff0d8",
    borderColor: "#d6e9c6",
    color: "#3c763d"
  },
  danger: {
    backgroundColor: "#f2dede",
    borderColor: "#ebccd1",
    color: "#a94442"
  }
};

class AlertList extends Component {
  renderAlertMessages = (alerts) => {
    return alerts.map((a) => 
      <div 
        key={a.timestamp}
        className={"alert alert-" + a.level }
        style={Object.assign(alertStyle,alertLevels[a.level])}
        children={a.message}
      />
    );
  }
  
  render() {
    return (
      <div className={"alert_list_" + this.props.scope}>
        { this.renderAlertMessages(this.props.alerts) }
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default AlertList;
```

We're borrowing some styles from Bootstrap CSS here to produce bootstrap-like alert boxes for our default component.  Two reasons here... for one, I just happen to really like this alert message style, I think they are very well done.  And the fact that bootstrap has normalized this look and feel through its huge popularity makes them even more effective in my opinion for alerting our users to important information.

Beyond that, I want to call attention to two approach we can take to style our components here.  I've implemented self-contained styles in our JavaScript for this component.  We've defined a base style constant with the common attributes shared by all four alert levels.  Then I've setup a nested object with the unique styles for each of the variations (info, warning, danger, success).

When our component builds each message it will use Object.assign to merge the base style, and the specific styles for each level into a single object and use it to style our component.

But you can also see this would have been easily done using Bootstraps class syntax.  We simply call `className`, and use our alert's properties to set the `.alert` and `.alert-"level"` class names.  The downside is we would then need to provide a bootstrap CSS file for our application.

All that is to say, you've got options, go with whatever style you enjoy using.

The last thing we need to take care of for this process is updating our application layout in `src/App.js`.

``` javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import './App.css'

import ReaderPane from './components/reader_pane';
import MenuBar from './components/menu_bar';
import FilteredNodesList from './containers/filtered_nodes_list';
import connectToAlerts from './containers/alert_provider';
let ApplicationAlerts = connectToAlerts();

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div id="app">
        <MenuBar />
        <ReaderPane>
          <ApplicationAlerts />
          <FilteredNodesList />
        </ReaderPane>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

Take note that we assign the return value of `connectToAlerts` to a variable, and then use the variable as a component inside our JSX.  This is a bit of my personal preference.  You could also just invoke your function inside the `render` method of the application component such as, `{ connectToAlerts() }`.  The net result would be the same.  I however like my JSX to be as uninterrupted as I can manage, so I like to isolate the function calls as shown in the example above.

Now, with our intentionally broken routes still in place inside our `instantiateBook` saga, let's look at what we've got to show for our efforts.

![Application level alert message](/images/8/ApplicationAlert.png)

That looks pretty good to me.  We won't be winning design awards for the look and feel just yet, but we are moving in the right direction.

### Clearing Alerts with a Simple Saga

Before we wrap up, we should introduce some mechanism to clear these alerts so they don't just pile up once we have more areas of our application pushing messages into this part of our state.

At the moment, clearing alerts on a route change seems like a good place to start.  If we outgrow that solution in the future, we can always revisit it.

Create a new saga at `src/sagas/clear_alerts.js`.

``` javascript
import { takeEvery, put } from 'redux-saga/effects';

import * as routes from '../constants/settings';
import { clearAlerts } from '../actions/alerts';

export function* watchRoutesToClearAlerts(){
  yield takeEvery(Object.keys(routes), () => put(clearAlerts()));
}
```

Take a look... all we're doing is using `Object.keys` to link this saga to all of our route action types.  Then we don't even need a worker saga to pair with our watcher, instead we'll just pass an anonymous function which will return the put effect using our `clearAlerts` action creator.  Don't forget to add this new saga to your root saga before testing!

``` javascript
import { all } from 'redux-saga/effects';
import { watchBookRoutesSaga } from './instantiate_book';
import { watchRoutesToClearAlerts } from './clear_alerts';

export default function* rootSaga(){
  yield all([
    watchBookRoutesSaga(),
    watchRoutesToClearAlerts()
  ]);
}
```

You'll have to test this one out in the console for now before you'll believe me, because we don't have many routes to pick from to change to, and none of them are accessible without an instantiated book.  But try loading a chapter route, then running `store.dispatch({type: "HOME_ROUTE"})` in the console.  You'll see the alert flash as it's cleared from our state (and added again when the route again fails to load).  You can also double check your work in the action history of ReduxDevTools to ensure `CLEAR_ALERTS` is being called as you would expect after the route change.

When you are satisfied everything is stitched together and working to your liking, restore the proper routes in your `instantiateBook` saga so that everything is back in working order.

## Closing out with Tests

The tests I've added with this chapter leverage the same strategies we've used in previous chapters, so we won't be going through them in detail.  They are included here though for context if you would like to review them, or copy them into your application.

In `src/actions/alerts`:

``` javascript
/* global expect */
import * as actions from './alerts';

describe("Alerts actionCreators", ()=>{
  describe("addAlerts(message, level, scope)", ()=>{
    test("assigns defaults for scope and level", () =>{
      let fsa = actions.addAlert("hello world");
      expect(fsa.payload.scope).toBeDefined();
      expect(fsa.payload.level).toBeDefined();
    });
    
    test("matches snapshot", () =>{
      let snap = actions.addAlert("hello world");
      snap.payload.timestamp = 0;
      expect(snap).toMatchSnapshot();
    });
  });
  
  describe("clearAlerts()",()=>{
    test("matches snapshot", () =>{
      expect(actions.clearAlerts()).toMatchSnapshot();
    });
  });
});
```

Our alertsReducer tests in `src/reducers/alerts`:

``` javascript
/* global expect */
import  alertsReducer, { normalizeAlert } from './alerts';
import * as actions from '../actions/alerts';

let defaultState = [];
let exampleState = [{message: "Test alert", level: "info", scope: "application", timestamp: 0}];

describe("alerts Reducer", ()=>{
  test("normalizeAlert enforces acceptable values for scope and level", ()=>{
    expect(normalizeAlert({message: "Test alert", timestamp: 0})).toEqual(exampleState[0]);
  });
  
  test("ADD_ALERT appends alert to array",()=>{
    let fsa = actions.addAlert("Test alert");
    fsa.payload.timestamp = 0;
    expect(alertsReducer(defaultState,fsa)).toEqual(exampleState);
  });
  
  test("CLEAR_ALERTS empties alerts array", () =>{
    expect(alertsReducer(exampleState, actions.clearAlerts())).toEqual([]);
  });
});
```

We should also add a red case branch for our `instantiateBook` saga's try/catch logic.  We can now add some testing to ensure we are dispatching an alert message if the instantiation fails.

``` javascript
/* global expect */
import { instantiateBook, checkBookHydration } from './instantiate_book';
import { cloneableGenerator } from 'redux-saga/utils';
import { select, all, call, put } from 'redux-saga/effects';
import axios from 'axios';

import { loadNodes } from '../actions/nodes';
import { loadChapters } from '../actions/chapters';
import { addAlert } from '../actions/alerts';

describe("checkBookHydration", ()=> {
  const cases = [
    {state: {nodes: [], chapters: [] }, outcome: true},
    {state: {nodes: ["populated"], chapters: [] }, outcome: true},
    {state: {nodes: [], chapters: ["populated"] }, outcome: true},
    {state: {nodes: ["populated"], chapters: ["populated"] }, outcome: false}
  ];
  
  cases.forEach((test_case) => {
    test("provides expected outcome", () => {
      expect(checkBookHydration(test_case.state)).toEqual(test_case.outcome);
    });
  });
});

describe("instantiateBook", () => {
  var saga = {};
  saga.gen = cloneableGenerator(instantiateBook)();
  
  test("begins by checking hydration of book nodes/chapters",() => {
    expect(saga.gen.next().value).toMatchObject(select(checkBookHydration));
    saga.dehydrated = { gen: saga.gen.clone() };
    saga.hydrated = saga.gen.clone();
  });
  
  describe("BRANCH dehydration === false ", ()=> {
    test("ends saga",() => {
      expect(saga.hydrated.next(false).done).toEqual(true);
    });
  });
  
  describe("BRANCH dehydration === true", ()=> {
    test("begins /api/nodes && api/chapters requests", ()=> {
      expect(saga.dehydrated.gen.next(true).value).toEqual(
        all([
          call(axios.get,'/api/nodes'),
          call(axios.get,'/api/chapters')
        ])
      );
      
      saga.dehydrated = {
        red: saga.dehydrated.gen.clone(),
        green: saga.dehydrated.gen.clone()
      };
    });
    
    describe("BRANCH try/catch === green", () => {
      test("dispatches loadNodes and loadChapters with returned data", ()=> {
        let [nodes, chapters] = [
          {data: [{content: "Test node"}]},
          {data: [{title: "Test Chapter"}]}
        ];
        
        expect(saga.dehydrated.green.next([nodes, chapters]).value).toEqual(all([
          put(loadNodes(nodes.data)),
          put(loadChapters(chapters.data))
        ]));
      });
    });
    
    describe("BRANCH try/catch === red", () => {
      test("dispatches ADD_ALERT with message of failed load", () =>{
        let red_case = saga.dehydrated.red.next(new Error("awww shiiit."));
        expect(red_case.value.PUT.action.type).toEqual("ADD_ALERT");
      });
    });
  });
});
```



Note that due to the simplicity of the `watchRoutesToClearAlerts` saga, I've elected to not put it under test.  Right now all the saga does is listen to our routes, and dispatch a single static action when a match is observed.  these basic features are well tested in redux-saga itself and I see little value in adding repeat coverage.  If the logic of this saga increases in complexity, we can revisit tests at that time.

## Wrapping Up

This chapter we introduced the concept of High Order Components, or HOCs.  Constructed by functions these components tend to be highly reusable and an excellent pattern when we need several components to make similar data connections.
