# Chapter 8: Managing API Connections with Sagas

So far, we have placed API requests haphazardly throughout our application as we ran into requirements for data.  In chapter seven, we saw errors when demand for data arose in our components before API requests completed.  It's time we got serious about managing our API communications.

React discourages managing API requests as part of your application's lifecycle methods.  It almost always leaves React running unnecessary render cycles.  Instead, our API requests should happen as side effects of actions dispatched to our Redux store.  Our components shouldn't get involved until Redux has received data, and prepared a new state.  To do this, we are introducing Redux Saga into our application.

## Getting Started 

If you're starting here or jumping between chapters, I recommend executing the code below to clone the project and check out the branch for this chapter.

``` bash
# Copy and paste the following commands to check out the starter commit
git clone https://github.com/swachtma/reactivating-rails-app.git && \
cd reactivating-rails-app && \
git checkout ch8-starter
```

## What About Thunk?

If you have used React/Redux for any amount of time, you have probably heard of a popular Middleware, redux-thunk (or simply Thunk).

Thunk is a middleware for Redux allows you to dispatch actions which return functions, instead of the everyday JavaScript objects.  Take a look at this simplified example Thunk.

``` javascript
  const loadChapterUnlessComplete = () => {
    return (dispatch,getState) => {
      if(getState().chapters === []){
        // Manage API call
        dispatch(actions.loadChapters(payload));
      }
    }
  }
```

Thunk's actions return functions which receive `dispatch` and `getState` from our store.  This design allows thunks to evaluate the current state of the store, and dispatch additional actions as needed.  

In the simplified example above, we check the state of `chapters` in the store.  If the store has already loaded chapters, we short-circuit our API call. Otherwise, we call the API and dispatch additional actions once we have a response.

Thunk is a very popular, and very powerful middleware.  So much so, our router, Redux First Router supports thunks natively.  Without even installing `redux-thunk`, your route map can dispatch a Thunk in response to a routing action.  That should give you some idea to how pervasive `redux-thunk` is in the Redux ecosystem.  

So why am I not using it here?  I have a personal preference for another tool.

## Redux Saga

We are using Redux Saga instead of Thunk to manage API communication.

If you haven't used Sagas before, you might want to study them independently before diving into Redux-Saga.  There's a video suggested in Redux Saga's documentation which gives [an excellent introduction to using sagas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDuwrtwYHu8) to simplify asynchronous programming.  Watch it as some optional homework if you want some foundation.

### ES2015 Generator Functions

Before covering Sagas, we need to discuss generator functions, a new feature of ES2015.

At their simplest, generators are special functions which can pause and resume their execution. Generators are declared using the `function*` keyword, and like functions, can accept a list of parameters.  

Typical functions run from beginning to end without interruption.  An invoked function either runs until it returns or a break terminates execution.

Generators, however, have access to a special keyword `yield`, which can pause their execution, passing control to other threads of your application.  Generators typically yield when performing asynchronous work.  A generator can begin its work and proceed until it requires unavailable data.  When a generator is awaiting data, it can yield control, later resuming execution when it's ready to proceed.  The context of generator functions (their scope inside the function's body) persists over their entire lifecycle.

Generators don't begin execution on their first invocation.  Instead, they return an *iterator*, which provides a `.next()` method.  This iterator is used to manage the execution of our generator throughout its lifecycle.  Let's look at some examples.

``` javascript
function* countForever(){
  let count = 1;
  while(true){
    console.log(count);
    count += 1;
    yield
  }
}

let counter = countForever();
// No console log here, instead we receive our iterator function.

counter.next()
//Console: 1
counter.next()
//Console: 2
counter.next()
//Console: 3
```

In a typical function, an infinite loop (`while(true)`) would permanently trap execution.  In a generator, each yield statement suspends execution until another call to `next()` is made.  That means every invocation of `counter.next()` allows one more pass through our loop, leading to another `yield`.  Since a generator's scope persist between executions, the variables inside can happily keep counting from where they left off, for as long as we need.

Each time your generator reaches a yield, it can also return a value.  In our example, each yield would return `{value: undefined, done: false}`.  The value attribute should be self-obvious.  The second attribute, `done` changes to `true` when the generator has reached its end (no remaining yields).  The above generator’s infinite loop ensures it never reaches its `done` state.

The iterators `next` method can also pass values into the generator.  Let's take a look.

``` javascript
function* countWithMeForever(){
  let count = 1;
  console.log("Let's count together!")
  
  while(true){
    let input = yield
    if(input === count){
      console.log(count + "!");
    } else {
      console.log("I think you meant " + count = "...");
    }
    count += 1;
  }
}

let counter = countForever();
// No console log here, instead we receive our iterator function.

counter.next()
//Console: Let's count together!
counter.next(1)
//Console: 1!
counter.next(2)
//Console: 2!
counter.next(2)
//Console: I think you meant 3...
```

Above, we set a value for `input` with each invocation of our iterator’s `next` method.  This value allows our counter to parrot back numbers, or to admonish us if we happen to lose count along the way.

The code we have worked with has, so far, been synchronous.  That makes our examples a bit contrived.  Generators shine when working with asynchronous actions.  Generators can begin working an asynchronous function, then yield execution to other threads while awaiting a response.  Once the asynchronous work is complete, the generator picks up where it left off.

Redux Saga uses generators to do just that.  Even better, Redux Saga by-in-large manages our iterators for us with its middleware. A library of helper methods called effects orchestrate common operations like running tasks in parallel, racing tasks, sequencing events, and more.

### Installing Redux Saga

Before we continue, let's put the installation of Redux Saga behind us.  Start with the package install `docker-compose exec client yarn add redux-saga`.

Then we need to modify our store to include Redux Saga's middleware.

``` javascript(/client/src/reducers/store.js)
import { createStore, combineReducers, applyMiddleware } from "redux";
import { composeWithDevTools } from 'redux-devtools-extension';
+ import createSagaMiddleware from 'redux-saga'
import { connectRoutes } from 'redux-first-router';
import restoreScroll from 'redux-first-router-restore-scroll'
import createHistory from 'history/createBrowserHistory';

import * as ROUTES from '../constants/settings';
import chapters from './chapters';
import nodes from './nodes';
import settings from './settings';

const history = createHistory();
- const routeMap = {
-   // Routes here "ACTION_NAME":"/some/route"
-   [ROUTES.HOME_ROUTE]: "/",
-   [ROUTES.CHAPTER_ROUTE]: "/chapter/:chapter_id"
- };

- const { 
-   reducer: routeReducer, middleware: routerMiddleware, enhancer: routerEnhancer
- } = connectRoutes( history, routeMap, { restoreScroll: restoreScroll() });

- const reducers = combineReducers(
-   {location: routeReducer, settings, nodes, chapters}
- );

+ const sagaMiddleware = createSagaMiddleware();
+ const middlewares = applyMiddleware(routerMiddleware, sagaMiddleware);

const store = createStore(
  reducers, composeWithDevTools(routerEnhancer, middlewares)
);

export default store;
```

`createSagaMiddleware` generates Redux Saga's middleware.  That middleware, passed to `applyMiddleware()`, ties it to our store. Just like that, we are ready to write our first saga.

## Saga Watchers and Workers

Sagas are described using the terms "watchers" and "workers".  Watcher sagas monitor our store for dispatched actions with a specific `type` attribute.  Once activated, watchers invoke worker sagas, which manage complex transformations of our application state.  

Our first goal working with sagas is to remove API calls from our component's lifecycle methods.  Instead, a saga can populate our store with chapters and nodes.

Our routing actions seem like a perfect signal to perform this work.  We can trigger our worker saga anytime a route changes attempts to display a chapter of our book.  That way, if we add future static pages that don't render our book, we can delay making any API calls for its contents; saving our API from processing needless requests.

## Our First Saga

Sagas are another significant layer of our client, so I prefer to store them in a dedicated folder.  Create a new file/folder at `src/sagas/routes.js`.

``` javascript(/client/src/sagas/instantiate_book.js)
import { takeEvery } from 'redux-saga/effects';

import routes from '../constants/routes';

export function* watchBookRoutesSaga(){
  yield takeEvery([routes.HOME_ROUTE, routes.CHAPTER_ROUTE], instantiateBook);
};
```

Above, we have a watcher monitoring our application’s home and chapter routes.  Using our routing constants file, we plug into the `type` values that dispatch when these routes fire.

The watcher itself is a generator function. It uses an effect provided by Redux Saga to watch the applicable route paths.  

In our crash course on generators, we were directly managing iterators and their `next()` methods.  Our work with Redux Saga is considerably easier because its middleware manages our iterators.  Generators we define use helpers called *effects* to yield plain JavaScript objects.  These objects are returned with `yield` statements to pass instructions to the saga middleware.  Each effect dictates when and how the middleware should resume work in a given saga, choreographing our asynchronous actions.

Above, an effect (`takeEvery`) triggers a new worker (`instantiateBook`), every time a `HOME_ROUTE` or `CHAPTER_ROUTE` action dispatches. 

Redux saga provides many different watcher effects/strategies.  Another effect, `takeLatest` could also be used here.  `takeLatest` differs by only allowing one instance of its worker a time.  Each time the watcher retriggers, `takeLatest` cancels any existing workers it's managing before instantiating a new worker.  `takeEvery`, by contrast, runs a worker instance for *every* matching action dispatched. 

Redux Saga simplifies complex sequencing operations, giving us effects for writing sagas expressively; describing how asynchronous processes transpire.  Let's look at a worker now.

``` javascript(/client/src/sagas/instantiate_book.js)
import { takeEvery, put, call } from 'redux-saga/effects';
import axios from 'axios';

import * as routes from '../constants/settings';
import { loadNodes } from '../actions/nodes';

export function* instantiateBook(){
  try{
    const response = yield call(axios.get,'/api/nodes');
    yield put(loadNodes(response.data));
    
  }
  catch(e){
    console.log(e);
  }
} 

- export function* watchBookRoutesSaga(){
-   yield takeEvery([routes.HOME_ROUTE, routes.CHAPTER_ROUTE], instantiateBook);
- };
```

Our generator wraps its work in a try/catch block.  This step makes introducing error management in the future easy, but for now, let's focus on the `try` branch.

Our work introduces several new Redux Saga effects.  Our first yield uses an effect `call`, which asynchronously invokes the passed function.  The function to be invoked is the first parameter of `call`, followed by a list of parameters for that function.  

Above, `call`  invokes `axios.get("/api/nodes")`, yielding control to the saga middleware, which executes our API call.  When the call returns a value, Redux Saga's middleware invokes the saga/generator's `next()` method, passing back the API's response.  Execution resumes at `yield`, which assigns the return value of our `call` to a constant `response`.

From there, execution continues until another yield, this time using the `put` effect, which dispatches actions to our store.  So, once our API responds, we load the return data using our `loadNodes` action creator.

We need to take one more housekeeping step.  Create a new file, `src/sagas/root.js`, and fill in the following code.

``` javascript(/client/src/sagas/root.js)
import { all } from 'redux-saga/effects';
import { watchBookRoutesSaga } from './routes';

export default function* rootSaga(){
  yield all([
    watchBookRoutesSaga()
  ]);
}
```

Sagas can themselves invoke other sagas, which we see here.  This `rootSaga` gives us a single point of entry to bind all other sagas to our middleware, and by extension our store.  It does this using the `all` effect, which runs several generators in parallel.  `rootSaga` uses `all` to simultaneously start all of our watchers monitoring our store for their respective trigger actions.

To finish, we still need a few modifications in `src/reducers/store.js`.

``` javascript(/client/src/reducers/store.js)
import { createStore, combineReducers, applyMiddleware } from "redux";
import { composeWithDevTools } from 'redux-devtools-extension';
+ import createSagaMiddleware from 'redux-saga'
import { connectRoutes } from 'redux-first-router';
import restoreScroll from 'redux-first-router-restore-scroll'
import createHistory from 'history/createBrowserHistory';

import * as ROUTES from '../constants/settings';
import chapters from './chapters';
import nodes from './nodes';
import settings from './settings';
+ import rootSaga from '../sagas/root';

const history = createHistory();
const routeMap = {
  // Routes here "ACTION_NAME":"/some/route"
  [ROUTES.HOME_ROUTE]: "/",
  [ROUTES.CHAPTER_ROUTE]: "/chapter/:chapter_id"
};

+ const { 
+   reducer: routeReducer,
+   middleware: routerMiddleware,
+   enhancer: routerEnhancer,
+   initialDispatch 
+ } = connectRoutes( 
+   history, routeMap, { restoreScroll: restoreScroll(), initialDispatch: false }
+ );

const reducers = combineReducers(
  {location: routeReducer, settings, nodes, chapters}
);

+ const sagaMiddleware = createSagaMiddleware();
+ const middlewares = applyMiddleware(sagaMiddleware, routerMiddleware);

const store = createStore(
  reducers, composeWithDevTools(routerEnhancer, middlewares)
);

+ sagaMiddleware.run(rootSaga);
+ initialDispatch();

export default store;
```

First, we need to modify our router setup where we invoke `connectRoutes`.  We are collecting a new return value `initialDispatch`, and also passing a new option `initialDispatch: false` in our options block.

Normally, Redux First Router fires the initial route's dispatch immediately upon connecting to our store.  This default causes a timing problem with redux-saga.  The new line `sagaMiddleware.run(rootSaga);` can't fire until after store creation.  If we allow Redux First Router to manage its initial dispatch, our sagas aren't in place to listen for the dispatched route in time.  To solve this, we are now manually firing the `initialDispatch` method after starting our sagas.

Next, update your `App.js` component to remove the API call for nodes.

``` javascript(/client/src/App.js)
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import './App.css'

import ReaderPane from './components/reader_pane';
import MenuBar from './components/menu_bar';
import FilteredNodesList from './containers/filtered_nodes_list';

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div id="app">
        <MenuBar />
        <ReaderPane>
          <FilteredNodesList />
        </ReaderPane>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

Doesn't that look nice?  We're saying goodbye to `componentWillMount` and its API call.  Since we no longer need the component to dispatch our `loadNodes` action, we can also cut `mapDispatchToProps`, and `connect`.  Plus we get to strip out all those module imports we no longer need.  That leaves us with a nice simple UI component.

Reload the application and make sure everything is running smoothly under your new saga based setup.

## Spying on our Sagas

Before moving on, let's look at our saga's yield values in detail.  I am going to assign our worker saga `instantiateBook` to our browser's window object so that I can run through some quick examples.  Let's look at just the worker and see what happens as we manually manage its iterator.

![Instantiate Book Iterator](/images/8/SagaGeneratorExample.png)

First, I am calling the generator and assigning the returned iterator to a variable, `saga`.

Upon invoking `saga.next`, the code runs to our first yield statement and our first effect.  Effects always return simple objects, which are managed by our middleware.  This object details the effect Redux Saga should use (`call`), and the information needed to manage the call.

The invocation of `saga.next` would receive the return value of our `call`, supplying it to yield where execution is resumed; setting our `response` variable.    Normally, that value would be an Axios response object, with an attribute `data`, which would deliver nodes from our API.

Our generator continues to its next yield, which contains our use of the `put` effect.  `put`, again returns an object for our middleware with instructions for the effect.  In this case, dispatching our action `loadNodes` to the store.

We're manually intervening to perform work typically handled by Redux Saga's middleware as a learning exercise.  However, this demonstration is the same strategy we use to implement saga tests.  We control the saga's progression by altering values supplied to `next` each time the iterator advances.  That enables us to do things like supply mock API responses, without actually needing to mock any interfaces.  

## Managing the Chapter Load

Let's add a request for our chapters to our saga so we can remove that API code from our components as well.

``` javascript(/client/src/sagas/instantiate_book.js)
import { takeEvery, put, call } from 'redux-saga/effects';
import axios from 'axios';

import * as routes from '../constants/settings';
import { loadNodes } from '../actions/nodes';
+ import { loadChapters } from '../actions/chapters';

export function* instantiateBook(){
  try{
    const response = yield call(axios.get,'/api/nodes');
+     const chapterResponse = yield call(axios.get,'/api/chapters');
    yield put(loadNodes(response.data));
+     yield put(loadChapters(chapterResponse.data));
  }
-   catch(e){
-     console.log(e);
-   }
} 

- export function* watchBookRoutesSaga(){
-   yield takeEvery([routes.HOME_ROUTE, routes.CHAPTER_ROUTE], instantiateBook);
- };
```

Now, update `src/containers/chapter_menu_items.js` since we no longer need it providing the `loadChapters` action creator.

``` javascript(/client/src/containers/controlled_chapter_menu_items.js)
import { connect } from 'react-redux';

import ChapterMenuItems from '../components/chapter_menu_items';
import { routeChapter } from '../actions/routes';

const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
  active_chapter: state.chapters.find(
   (chapter) => chapter.id === state.settings.active_chapter_id
  ),
  chapters: state.chapters
});

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => ({
  dispatchRouteChapter: (event,target) => dispatch(routeChapter(target.value))
});

export default connect(mapStateToProps,mapDispatchToProps)(ChapterMenuItems);
```

`src/components/chapter_menu_items.js` can be updated as well to remove our API call.

``` javascript(/client/src/components/chapter_menu_items.js)
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Dropdown } from 'semantic-ui-react';

export default class ChapterMenuItems extends Component {
  renderChapterOptions = () => {
    let chapters_list = [];
    this.props.chapters.forEach((chapter) => {
      chapters_list.push(
        { 
          key: "chapter_" + chapter.id,
          id:  "chapter_menu_item_" + chapter.id,
          value: chapter.id,
          text: chapter.title,
          active: chapter.id === this.props.active_chapter.id
        }
      );
    });
    return chapters_list;
  }
  
  render() {
    if(this.props.chapters !== [] && this.props.active_chapter){
      return( 
        <Dropdown 
          tabIndex="1"
          placeholder="Jump to Chapter..."
          className="link item"
          selectOnNavigation={false}
          value={this.props.active_chapter.id}
          text={this.props.active_chapter.title}
          onChange={this.props.dispatchRouteChapter}
          options={this.renderChapterOptions()} 
        />
      );
    } else {
      return null;
    }
  }
}
```

Reload, and your saga now fully manages instantiation of the book.  We can still make improvements though.

If you look at the network tab of your browser, you can see a weakness of our saga.  Because yield surrenders execution until each API call resolves, our two tasks run in sequence.  Our first `yield` calls the API for nodes and awaits a response.  Then, progressing to the next `yield`, it calls for chapters and again awaits a response.

You can see this play out by timing network requests in the browser console.  In testing, my `/api/nodes` request started at ~900ms, while the call to `/api/chapters` began at ~1.6 seconds.

![Nodes Sequenced Request](/images/8/NodesSequenceRequest.png)
![Chapters Sequenced Request](/images/8/ChaptersSequenceRequest.png)

### Running Requests in Parallel

Reworking our Saga, we can run API requests in parallel using an effect `all`, which we first saw in our root saga.  The `all` effect runs tasks in parallel, pausing the saga's execution until *all* work is complete.  Alternatively, if one task given to `all` fails, the entire effect ends in an error.

``` javascript(/client/src/sagas/instantiate_book.js)
+ import { takeEvery, put, call, all } from 'redux-saga/effects';
import axios from 'axios';

import * as routes from '../constants/settings';
import { loadNodes } from '../actions/nodes';
import { loadChapters } from '../actions/chapters';

export function* instantiateBook(){
  try{
+     const [nodes, chapters] = yield all([
+       call(axios.get,'/api/nodes'),
+       call(axios.get,'/api/chapters')
+     ]);
    
+     yield all([
+       put(loadNodes(nodes.data)),
+       put(loadChapters(chapters.data))
+     ]);
  }
  catch(e){
    console.log(e);
  }
} 

- export function* watchBookRoutesSaga(){
-   yield takeEvery([routes.HOME_ROUTE, routes.CHAPTER_ROUTE], instantiateBook);
- };
```

Now when I check my network requests, I see both calls fire simultaneously (and the whole process finishing more quickly I might add).

There's more to fix though.  Flip between a few different chapters; what’s happening?  We are firing this saga on every routing dispatch, needlessly harassing our API for data we already have.  But don't worry, there's an effect for that.

### Checking Store Values in a Saga

Let's add a check to our saga to verify its need to fire our API requests.

``` javascript(/client/src/sagas/instantiate_book.js)
import { takeEvery, select, put, call, all } from 'redux-saga/effects';
import axios from 'axios';

import * as routes from '../constants/settings';
import { loadNodes } from '../actions/nodes';
import { loadChapters } from '../actions/chapters';

+ export const checkBookHydration = (state) => {
+   return !(state.chapters.length && state.nodes.length)
+ }

export function* instantiateBook(){
+   const dehydrated = yield select(checkBookHydration);
  
+   if(dehydrated){
-     try{
-       const [nodes, chapters] = yield all([
-         call(axios.get,'/api/nodes'),
-         call(axios.get,'/api/chapters')
-       ]);
-       
-       yield all([
-         put(loadNodes(nodes.data)),
-         put(loadChapters(chapters.data))
-       ]);
-     }
-     catch(e){
-       console.log(e);
-     }
+   }
} 

- export function* watchBookRoutesSaga(){
-   yield takeEvery([routes.HOME_ROUTE, routes.CHAPTER_ROUTE], instantiateBook);
- };
}
```

The `select` effect is used to query our store from within sagas. Since this query runs asynchronously, you need to define a function to use as your query.  In our example, `select` checks our state's `nodes` and `chapters` keys, flagging the book as "dehydrated" if either has a length of zero.  The saga only executes our API queries if it advances in this dehydrated state. 

We've created our selector function as a standalone exportable, that way it is easier to grab for testing.

## Sagas Shine in Testing

With API interactions now migrated to our saga, we should add some tests.

When we test sagas, we feed `next()` with return values for each yield.  This manual intervention allows us to progress the saga, testing expectations about what the saga **should** do given a specific yield.  We can test our sagas without actually mocking any external interfaces (like our API, or our store).

However, by directly managing our iterator's progression, we shortcut around our selector function's actual execution.  That means the selector won't be under test unless we test it independently.  Since writing the function's logic test took me four tries to get right; I should probably test it.

``` javascript(/client/src/sagas/instantiate_book.spec.js)
import { checkBookHydration } from './instantiate_book';

describe("checkBookHydration", ()=>{
  const cases = [
    {state: {nodes: [], chapters: [] }, outcome: true},
    {state: {nodes: ["populated"], chapters: [] }, outcome: true},
    {state: {nodes: [], chapters: ["populated"] }, outcome: true},
    {state: {nodes: ["populated"], chapters: ["populated"] }, outcome: false}
  ];
  
  cases.forEach((test_case) =>{
    test("provides expected outcome", () =>{
      expect(checkBookHydration(test_case.state)).toEqual(test_case.outcome);
    });
  });
});
```

Here's a new Jest trick.  I am creating an array of sample data, and then using `Array.forEach` to run my assertions against each member.  My array supplies a state and an expected outcome for each test run.  We expect our selector function to return true when the sample state contains at least one empty Array.

Now, let's move on to our Saga itself.

``` javascript(/client/src/sagas/instantiate_book.spec.js)
/* global expect */
import { instantiateBook, checkBookHydration } from './instantiate_book';
import { select } from 'redux-saga/effects';

- describe("checkBookHydration", ()=>{
-   const cases = [
-     {state: {nodes: [], chapters: [] }, outcome: true},
-     {state: {nodes: ["populated"], chapters: [] }, outcome: true},
-     {state: {nodes: [], chapters: ["populated"] }, outcome: true},
-     {state: {nodes: ["populated"], chapters: ["populated"] }, outcome: false}
-   ];
-   
-   cases.forEach((test_case) =>{
-     test("provides expected outcome", () =>{
-       expect(checkBookHydration(test_case.state)).toEqual(test_case.outcome);
-     });
-   });
- });

describe("instantiateBook", () =>{
  var saga = instantiateBook();
  
  test("begins by checking hydration of book nodes/chapters",() =>{
+     expect(saga.next().value).toMatchObject(select(checkBookHydration))
  })
  
  test("ends saga if book is not dehydrated",() => {
+     expect(saga.next(false).done).toEqual(true);
  })
});
```

We are going to progress through our generator using its iterator's `next` method.  When I set up my test in the `describe` block, I am purposefully **not** using a `beforeEach` block.  We don't want the test to reset our generator each time we test an assertion.  Instead, our tests run in one continuous stream for the entire saga.

To begin, we test the first return of `saga.next()`.  Its value should be a `select` effect.  Remember, the saga middleware would normally execute this effect.  We only need to verify our saga is dictating the correct effects at each step of its progression.  Therefore, we check `saga.next().value`, expecting it to contain an object representing the `select` effect, and using `checkBookHydration` as its selector function.

The next test advances the saga again, this time supplying a value to `next()`. This value is essentially a mock; rather than imitating an external interface, we short-cut to an expected response, supplying it directly to our iterator.  In this case `select(checkBookHydration)` should return a boolean.  When false, we expect the saga to be complete, returning an object with an attribute `done` marked `true`.

Alas, now we have a problem.  We just resolved our generator but didn't test its dehydrated path.  We could start the next test by setting up a new iterator, invoking `saga.next()`, and then `saga.next(true)`.  However, it would be a headache, and not very clear.

Luckily, redux-saga ships the helpful `cloneableGenerator` to make this easier.

``` javascipt(/client/src/sagas/instantiate_book.spec.js)
/* global expect */
import { instantiateBook, checkBookHydration } from './instantiate_book';
import { cloneableGenerator } from 'redux-saga/utils';
import { select, all, call, put } from 'redux-saga/effects';
import axios from 'axios';

import { loadNodes } from '../actions/nodes';
import { loadChapters } from '../actions/chapters';

- describe("checkBookHydration", ()=>{
-   const cases = [
-     {state: {nodes: [], chapters: [] }, outcome: true},
-     {state: {nodes: ["populated"], chapters: [] }, outcome: true},
-     {state: {nodes: [], chapters: ["populated"] }, outcome: true},
-     {state: {nodes: ["populated"], chapters: ["populated"] }, outcome: false}
-   ];
-   
-   cases.forEach((test_case) =>{
-     test("provides expected outcome", () =>{
-       expect(checkBookHydration(test_case.state)).toEqual(test_case.outcome);
-     });
-   });
- });

describe("instantiateBook", () => {
  var saga = {}
+   saga.gen = cloneableGenerator(instantiateBook)();
  
  test("begins by checking hydration of book nodes/chapters",() => {
    expect(saga.gen.next().value).toMatchObject(select(checkBookHydration))
+     saga.dehydrated = saga.gen.clone();
+     saga.hydrated = saga.gen.clone();
  })
  
  describe("BRANCH dehydration === false", ()=> {
    test("ends saga",() => {
      expect(saga.hydrated.next(false).done).toEqual(true);
    });
  });
  
  describe("BRANCH dehydration === true", ()=> {
    test("begins /api/nodes && api/chapters requests", ()=> {
      expect(saga.dehydrated.next(true).value).toEqual(all([
        call(axios.get,'/api/nodes'),
        call(axios.get,'/api/chapters')
      ]));
    });
    
    test("dispatches loadNodes and loadChapters with returned data", ()=> {
      let [nodes, chapters] = [
        {data: [{content: "Test node"}]},
        {data: [{title: "Test Chapter"}]}
      ];
      
      expect(saga.dehydrated.next([nodes, chapters]).value).toEqual(all([
        put(loadNodes(nodes.data)),
        put(loadChapters(chapters.data))
      ]));
    });
  });
});
```

When creating our generator, we instantiate it with `cloneableGenerator` allowing us to clone our generator’s current state at any time.  Our first test proceeds as normal, but before closing the test, we clone generators for the hydrated/dehydrated logic split in our saga.  I prefer to keep all my saga branches in an object, that way I can use dot-naming syntax to give each a descriptive name detailing the saga's progression.  Therefore the branches I create are named `saga.hydrated` and `saga.dehydrated`.

Opening a new describe block for each branch, we can carry on testing.  

The hydrated branch we saw previously.  The dehydrated branch begins by testing that our API calls fire if `dehydrated == true`.  As we did with our `select` test, we invoke the same effects we expect the generator to use in our tests and compare the object returned by our iterator.  In this case, we're expecting `all` and several `call` generators.

The `dehydrated` branch then advances again.  Our `loadChapters` and `loadNodes` actions should dispatch when yielded data from our API calls.

That gives us test coverage on the "green" paths through the saga.  We are missing tests on our `catch` branch, but we can write those once we're doing something more robust than logging errors to the console.

## Wrapping Up

This chapter was mainly a refactor of our application.  We didn't come away with any new features to show for our efforts, but a fundamental piece of our application is much more scalable and testable.  With Redux, Redux First Router, and Redux Saga, our entire application is built to make our store a single source of truth.  Now the fun begins.

To this point, the amount of state we've had to manage has been minimal, and it is arguable that we could have built this application easily in vanilla Rails.  Now, with groundwork set, we can start building more robust client-side features to make our application shine.  See you in chapter 8!
