# Chapter 3: Loading and Displaying Basic Content

This chapter, working in our API and client project directories, we bootstrap a minimum viable first iteration of our reader.  We are going to do some things wrong in this chapter for the sake of doing them quickly and highlighting new concepts.  Try not to sweat the details at this point; we are putting up a scaffold of better things to come. 

## Start with the Hotdogs

Jason Fried's [Rework](https://www.aamazon.com/Rework-Jason-Fried/dp/0307463745/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1502762510&sr=8-1), might be the best programming book I have ever read.  Maybe an odd claim, considering the book contains not one single line of code.  However, Rework reads like a manifesto for builders; whether that means businesses or software.  Given Basecamp's connections to the very root of the Rails community, I think it makes an excellent source of guidance as we embark on our first iteration.

Rework teaches that we should focus on the most crucial part of a thing first.  That we should not be distracted by the accouterments to the detriment of the basics.  The analogy Jason uses is that of a hot dog cart.  Put plainly; if you are going to open a hot dog cart, the first place to focus attention is the hotdogs.  Forget the buns, condiments, the cart, or the marketing. You need hotdogs.

An apt analogy, because if there is one thing you probably **don't** want to focus on the inner workings of in too much detail, it's a hotdog.  Given a choice between hot dogs, and anything else on the cart, I would rather avoid knowing too much about the hotdogs.

We could focus our first iteration on the trimmings.  We need Redux, so we might as well install that now.  How will we turn our markdown into beautiful HTML?  Maybe someone already has a parser written we can use or adapt.  Maybe we should go looking for a gem.  What about our routing; should we go ahead and install react-router now, or maybe redux-little-router is a better fit for our stack? I would hate to choose the wrong one, so maybe I should read some blogs about the pro and cons...

Or, we could make hotdogs.  Not sexy, but right now anything else would be a distraction.  If we are building an e-reader, then the first feature we should scratch off the list is providing something to read.

## Getting Started 

If you're starting here or jumping between chapters, I recommend executing the code below to clone the project and check out the branch for this chapter.

```bash
# Copy and paste the following commands to check out the starter commit
git clone https://github.com/swachtma/reactivating-rails-app.git && \
cd reactivating-rails-app && \
git checkout project-starter
```

## Simple Requirements

Let's consider our requirements.  When you have blue sky in front of you, everything seems simultaneously possible, and impossible.  We need to pick out some business rules big enough to get us started, but not so big that our first iteration gets away from us.

Here's a short list of ideas:
* We need to import a selection of .md files and display their contents to our users.
* We need to enforce the content's order.
    * That assumes there is some division of our content
    * We could enforce an order by strict naming conventions
    * We could create simple rules (chapters ordered alphabetically by file name)
* We need a way to pass content to our React views.
    * We could pass all the content in its original raw markdown format.
    * We could parse content server-side and pass HTML or structured content

At its root, our problem seems simple: we need to read content in, and we need to display it.  I am inclined to lean towards the simplest solution to each problem.  However, if I am honest, this is an area that often vexes me as a programmer.  The most straightforward approach I can see does not lead in the direction my gut says we are going in the medium, let alone long-term.

For example, we could import our markdown files directly with our React client, and cut the server out entirely in the preliminary stages of our application.  We could go very far indeed without ever involving an API server at all.  

Since we know our path eventually leads us to an API, (it is a book about using React with Rails after all), it seems a shame to architect things on the client-side to then migrate them to the API.

With that in mind, here's my compromised spec:
* Rails should expect a collection of markdown files in a project directory.
    * These files should be parsed by the API and sent to the client.
* When the client boots, it should request the book content from the API.
* When the client receives content, it should render the text to the screen.

Not as simple as we could make it, but this is the most distilled version of our project intent I can create at this moment.  

## Reading on Rails

We need a place to house our book's raw markdown documents.  I am inclined to use the `lib/` directory of our API. I expect our book import might run on a scheduled basis in the future and since Rails 5 expects scheduled tasks to live in `lib/tasks`, this seems like the perfect place.

If you used Docker Compose to assemble your project, I have already cloned a copy of the book into `/api/lib/reactivating-rails` for you.  Otherwise, navigate to your lib directory and clone the book using the command `git clone https://github.com/swachtma/reactivating-rails`.

### Our First Controller Action

We can now generate our first controller action to prepare our application to send the book's content to our client.

Hold on though; we don't have Rails installed on our local machine (at least I don't).  So how are we going to make use of Rails generator functions if Rails only exists within our container?  Quite easily in fact.  Docker Compose allows you to run commands against a running container by prepending some instructions to your command.  This command takes the format of `docker-compose exec <container_name> <command>`

So to run a Rails generator to create our new controller, open a new terminal at your project root and run `docker-compose exec api bin/rails generate controller api/books index`.

Notice the use of `api/controller` in our generator command.  That tells Rails to create our controller action inside an `api/` directory.  It also makes that Controller Class part of the `Api` namespace automatically and sets up a matching namespaced route.  Not bad for one command.

While this is close to what I want, the generated route lands our index at `localhost/api/book/index`.  Conventions for index actions do not typically require you to include *index* explicitly in the path.  Let's update `config/routes.rb` as follows:

``` ruby(/api/config/routes.rb)
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  namespace :api do
+     get 'book/', to: "books#index"
  end
  # For details on the DSL available within this file,
  # see http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html
end
```

I am using an index action here since I plan to deliver the book's entire contents in one request.  A `#show` action might feel more aptly named, but convention would expect a `show` action to accept an ID parameter in the route specifying a subset of our content.  Since we are going to be loading the book in full, `#index` seems to be the better fit for now.

### Fat, Fat, Fat Controller

We are about to write some ugly Rails.  We are going to cram more stuff into one controller than is wise, or acceptable.  Bear with me.  This first pass is not the code intended for the long term.  We are just looking to set a foundation (even a shaky one) on which we can begin building our application.

Open the new books#index controller we just generated.

If we are going to display our book data inside the client, we first need to locate the book's chapter files.  Then we must examine each valid file, and convert the data inside into a format we can send to the client.

Let start with fetching the raw data:
``` ruby(/api/app/controllers/api/books_controller.rb)
class Api::BooksController < ApplicationController
  def index
    book_dir = "lib/reactivating-rails/"
+     raw_file_list = Dir.entries(book_dir)
  end
end
```

First, we fetch an array of all the files in our book's directory using `Dir.entries`.  Unfortunately, this also returns entries such as `..` in our set.  We also pull back the `README.md` file.  This README is a markdown file, but not an actual chapter of the book's content.

Let's use the `Array.select` method to narrow down our list of files.  `Array.select` allows us to pass each member of an array to a block, and returns a new filtered array containing only members whose values caused the block to evaluate `true`.

If our case we are evaluating 3 criteria in our block:
1. The member must be a file
2. The member must have the extension `.md`
3. The filename must not be `readme.md`

Here's how that looks.

``` ruby(/api/app/controllers/api/books_controller.rb)
class Api::BooksController < ApplicationController
  def index
    book_dir = "lib/reactivating-rails/"
    raw_file_list = Dir.entries(book_dir)
    
+     filtered_file_list = raw_file_list.select do |file|
+       path = book_dir + file
+       File.file?(path) && \
+       File.extname(path) == ".md" && \
+       !/readme\.md/i.match?(file)
+     end
end
```

Now our vairable `filtered_file_list` should contain a value similar to `["1.md", "2.md", ...] `

Next, we need to read those files and process their content to a response.  For simplicity, I am going to structure that response as an ordered array of our content.

``` ruby(/api/app/controllers/api/books_controller.rb)
class Api::BooksController < ApplicationController
  def index
    book_dir = "lib/reactivating-rails/"
    raw_file_list = Dir.entries(book_dir)
    
-     filtered_file_list = raw_file_list.select do |file|
-       path = book_dir + file
-       File.file?(path) && \
-       File.extname(path) == ".md" && \
-       !/readme\.md/i.match?(file)
-     end
    
+     filtered_file_list.sort!
+     payload = []
+     filtered_file_list.each do |file|
+       File.open(book_dir + file).each { |line| payload.append(line) }
+     end
+     
+     render json: {payload: payload}, status: 200
  end
end

```

First, I am invoking a destructive `Array.sort_by!` method on my list of filtered names.  For now, we are relying on the names of our chapter files being numerically ordered to enforce the order of the book's content.

We then set up an empty `payload` array we can build our response inside.

We then loop through each file in our list.  With each file, we read line by line, appending to our array as we go.  Ruby helpfully lets us enumerate through files line by line, so we do not need to do any special string parsing to pull this off.

Finally, we need to render our JSON response.  For now, we use a simple object structure, passing only a single key `payload`, containing our array.

We're passing a status code 200 (Status OK) with our JSON response.  In the future, other response codes might be used to pass back different error responses as well. For now, it is a good habit to have a response code included in our route outcomes.

With all that in place, let's run a quick test with curl.  Our updated route should have the action hosted on `http://localhost:3000/api/book`. 

However, the request proxy mentioned in Chapter 2 should also ensure that we have that same resource available (by proxy), on port 80 where our client application is bound.  Let's test both of those items in one pass using the command, `curl http://localhost/api/book/`.  Then test again with `curl http://localhost:3000/api/book/`.

With both requests you should get back a fairly substantial block of JSON in the form: `{ "payload": [ ... ] }`.  When we target curl at the client on port 80 it doesn't know how to respond, so Create React App helpfully forwards the request to the proxy defined in our package.json file.  This proxy helps immensely when making API requests from our client.   Because we can refer to our API routes as local routes, we're saved fighting with server configurations designed to allow such requests to happen cross-origin.

With that in place, we have enough scaffolded that we can turn our attention to the client.

## Our First API Call

Now that we have some content ready for serving, we can build our first client-side view.

To communicate with our API, we need a way to manage client-side requests.  We could do this with vanilla JavaScript, but I am going to farm out this work to a library called [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios), which gives us a promise based architecture we can rely on to handle our API communications consistently cross-browser.

### Installing Axios

We can install Axios using Yarn.  However, just like running our Rails generators in the previous section, we need to point our install command at the correct Docker container.

From your project root directory run `docker-compose exec client yarn add axios@0.18.0`

Above, we point our command at the `client` container.  If you open your `package.json` file, you should see `"axios": "0.18.0",` listed among your dependencies.

### Setting the Default Component State

Keeping to the path of least resistance, we are going to modify the `App.js` component that CRA bootstrapped for us.  Like our first API update, we're going to be fattening up this component with some sloppy code to get us quickly to the goal of our first iteration.

Before we even touch an API call, let's make some enhancements to our starter component `/client/src/App.js`.  Before we fetch API data, we need to set up a place in our state to store the response.  Also, since loading the book happens asynchronously, we should also set some default/placeholder text to display until our API request completes.

``` javascript(/client/src/App.js)
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';

class App extends Component {
+   constructor(props){
+     super(props);
+     this.state = {
+       book_body: ["Loading, please wait..."]
+     };
+   }
  
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <div className="App-header">
          <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
          <h2>Welcome to React</h2>
        </div>
        <div className="App-intro">
        </div>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

Using a constructor method, we add a state to our App component.  Inside the constructor, we instantiate a `state` object and create a property `book_body`, which stores an array, initially holding default text.  

Next, we need to render out that default text, again keeping in mind that we are going to have to repeat and update this process when the book loads.

For this, set up a function `renderContentBlocks`, which will return an updated array of HTML elements:

``` javascript(/client/src/App.js)
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';

class App extends Component {
-   constructor(props){
-     super(props);
-     this.state = {
-       book_body: ["Loading, please wait..."]
-     };
-   }
  
+   renderContentBlocks = (content) => 
+     content.map((block,i) => <p key={i}>{block}</p>);

  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <div className="App-header">
          <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
+           <h2>Reactivating Rails: A work in progress</h2>
        </div>
        <div className="App-intro">
+           { this.renderContentBlocks(this.state.book_body) }
        </div>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

We are using the new ES6 arrow function syntax here to prevent the function creating its own binding for `this`.  We expect this function to take one argument: an array of content.

Looping through each element in the passed `content` array, we map the text into HTML paragraphs.  Notice that we are also using the index of each element we are constructing to assign a `key` property to each paragraph.  Unique key values are necessary whenever you create a collection of elements to render. 

> **Note:** I feel obligated to point out here that the numerical index of an array makes a lousy key.  In the future, we can use our Active Record IDs to give these values more stability and meaning.

We have also updated our `render` method to use this new function.  React helps us here by automatically rendering any arrays of HTML elements or components included in `render`.  I have also made an update to our page title as well.

Go ahead and test in your browser by visiting your `localhost`.

### Making the Call

With the foundation set, we can add our API call.

React components fire a `componentWillMount` method before their first render cycle.  Since we do not expect the book API to change frequently, this lifecycle method is a better fit our needs for now.

``` javascript(/client/src/App.js)
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';

class App extends Component {
-   constructor(props){
-     super(props);
-     this.state = {
-       book_body: ["Loading, please wait..."]
-     };
-   }

  componentWillMount(){
    axios.get("/api/book").then(response =>
      this.setState(
        prevState => ({book_body: response.data.payload})
      )
    ).catch(error => console.log(error));
  }
  
  renderContentBlocks = (content) => 
    content.map((block,i) => <p key={i}>{block}</p>);

-   render() {
-     return (
-       <div className="App">
-         <div className="App-header">
-           <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
-           <h2>Welcome to React</h2>
-         </div>
-         <div className="App-intro">
-           { this.renderContentBlocks(this.state.book_body) }
-         </div>
-       </div>
-     );
-   }
- }

export default App;
```

To start, we import Axios as a module within this component.

Since Axios is promise based, we can add API calls to our component’s lifecycle methods without it blocking rendering.  When Axios receives its response, it returns execution to the `then` method chained to our promise, or the `catch` method in instances where the call produces an error.

For now, we limit the `catch` branch of the promise to logging the error. 

Focus on the `then` branch of our promise.  We are expecting Axios to return a response object, which should house the content of our book at `response.data.payload`.  Using React's `setState` method we update the book_body property in our state.

setState receives an anonymous function, which in turn receives the previous (current) application state as a parameter.  `setState` is expected to return a **new** object representing the component state, **not** an updated copy of the previous state object.  Hence our anonymous function returns a new object, using the object literal syntax, with its book_body attribute set to the content we received from our API.

When our component state changes, it rerenders using that updated state, and we have our book.

## Refactoring the API logic

At this point, we have a hotdog.   We packed it full of unsavory bits, and I would rather no one ever know what's going on inside.  Still, the end product is something that very minimally fulfills our requirements.

Now it's time to refactor.  I am less concerned about our client because I foresee us abandoning this front-end implementation entirely as our needs evolve.  The API is already doing things that may be around for the long term; namely locating and parsing chapter files.  It is also doing them in a very inappropriate place.  We won't be able to solve all our problems now, but we can take some positive steps.

We should take a moment to implement some tests on features that might be sticking around.

### Refactoring books#index

Let's skinny down our fat controller, so it's not managing the minutia of loading content.  Instead, our action should focus on the request/response process.

There are two steps crammed in `books#index`  that do not belong:
1. Locating relevant chapter files from a directory
2. Processing those files into a response format

Let's move each of these processes to standalone class.  Those class files should live in `controllers/concerns`, since we invoke them in our controller actions (for now).

There is another substantial problem; we are treating each file line we read as a distinct block of content.  However, Markdown files use several elements that are block-level (meaning they store other elements as parts of their structure).  Since we treat every line as a new block, we are breaking those elements apart.

That won't fly when we want to parse into full HTML.  So as we refactor let's extend our parsing logic to better deal with this case.

All this ignores the glaring problem that we reprocess this response from scratch on **every** request.  Easily addressed, but best deferred for the moment.

### Finding Files

Let's start with the file location problem since it is the easier refactor.  

I think our Class should provide us a filtered array of files.  Right now, our code generates an ordered list of **only** file names.  That approach places a burden on our controller to build out a full file path.  Ideally, the file locator class would return a ready to use array containing the full path to each file.

Start by refactoring our controller code to that new interface.

``` ruby(/api/app/controllers/api/books_controller.rb)
class Api::BooksController < ApplicationController
  def index
+     file_list = BookFileFinder.new("lib/reactivating-rails/").entries
    
    payload = []
+     file_list.each do |file|
+       File.open(file).each { |line| payload.append(line) }
+     end
    
    render json: {payload: payload}, status: 200
  end
end
```

Notice we stripped out directory traversal and filtering of files from the action.  Instead, we instantiate a new instance of `BookFileFinder`, and expect it to provide an entries attribute: `file_list = BookFileFinder.new("lib/reactivating-rails/").entries`

Our line parsing logic remains unchanged for now, except we expect `entries` to contain full paths ready for use in `File.open`.  Let's set up the actual `BookFileFinder` class.

``` ruby(api/app/controllers/concerns/book_file_finder.rb)
class BookFileFinder
  attr_reader :entries
  
  def initialize(path)
    @path = path 
    @entries = locate_chapter_files.sort_by! {|x| File.basename(x,".md").to_i}
  end
  
  def locate_chapter_files
    raw_file_list = expand_file_paths(Dir.entries(@path))
    filter_chapter_files(raw_file_list);
  end
  
  def filter_chapter_files(raw_file_list)
    filtered_list = raw_file_list.select do |file|
        File.file?(file) && \
        File.extname(file) == ".md" && \
        !/readme\.md/i.match?(file)
    end
  end
  
  def expand_file_paths(file_array)
    file_array.map do |file|
      @path + file
    end
  end
end
```

First, we declare an attr_reader for our class' public interface, `entries`.  

Our class' `initialize` function expects a path to our book's directory.  It also sets our `entries` attribute by invoking `locate_chapter_files`.  Most of that logic migrates over directly from our controller.  

We have introduced the `expand_file_paths`  where we use `Array.map` to prepend `@path` to each filename in our directory.  Then, as we saw in our controller; the list of files is filtered to contain only chapter files, and sorted alphabetically.

Now refresh your client and ensure nothing has broken during our refactor.

### Upgrading our Parser

Now let's give an upgrade to our parsing logic.

A line by line parse of our Markdown files is going to cause issues where block elements span multiple lines.  For security and simplicity, a full translation of Markdown to HTML should happen client-side.  Still, we could benefit from having Ruby take a first pass to identify block elements.  That way we aren't creating new problems we need to solve.

Let's take a server-side pass to divided files into block elements of Markdown rather than individual lines.  We won't translate anything into HTML yet since Markdown makes it easier for us to pass data around.

To start, install the `commonmarker` gem by adding `gem 'commonmarker', '0.17.9'` to your Gemfile.  Then run a `bundle install`, being sure to direct the command to your API Docker container (`docker-compose exec api bundle install`).  

**Note:** You need to restart your API server after editing gems.  Kill your terminal running docker compose, and then run a fresh `docker compose up`.

When Bundler finishes, create a new file to define another class, `BookFileParser`.

``` ruby(/api/app/controllers/concerns/book_file_parser.rb)
class BookFileParser
  attr_reader :payload
  
  def initialize(files_array)
     @files_array = files_array
     @payload = []
     parse_chapter_files
  end
  
  def parse_chapter_files
    @files_array.each do |file|
      raw_doc = File.read(file)
      md_doc = CommonMarker.render_doc(raw_doc)
      md_doc.each do |node|
        @payload.push(node.to_commonmark)
      end
    end
  end
end
```

Start by setting up an initializer to create two instance variables; `@files_array` and `@payload`.  We also set an attribute reader for `@payload` making it the external interface of our class.

The `parse_chapter_files` method processes Markdown files.  We use the array of file paths from `BookFileFinder` to loop all our chapter files.  We have changed to `File.read` from `File.open`;  giving us the entire file as a string rather than providing it line by line.

The entirety of each file is passed to `CommonMarker.render_doc`.  CommonMarker translates Markdown files into a map of nodes.  We can enumerate through the top level of this node map using `.each`.  We then instruct `CommonMarker` to return this node in Markdown so that we can provide it to the payload.

Now we can simplify our `books#index` action to use this class to construct our payload.

``` ruby(/api/app/controllers/api/books_controller.rb)
class Api::BooksController < ApplicationController
  def index
    file_list = BookFileFinder.new("lib/reactivating-rails/").entries
+     payload = BookFileParser.new(file_list).payload
    render json: {payload: payload}, status: 200
  end
end
```

Revisit your application in the browser and look at one of its list nodes.  There is still a long way to go, but block elements are no longer cut into separate nodes.  That is a real first step.

![List item contents rendered as a single HTML element](/images/3/updatedListRender.png)

## Add Some Tests

With our spec complete, let's turn our attention to testing.

I am going to forego testing books#index for now, as I do not expect it to remain with us for very long.  The two classes created while refactoring are likely to last though.  Having some tests on the public interfaces of these classes would be wise.

To install Rspec (rspec-rails actually), add `gem 'rspec-rails', '3.6.1'`  to your Gemfile in the `:development` and `:test` group.  Then direct Docker to run `bundle install` in your API container. 

Next, run the included generator to set up your `spec/` directory: `docker-compose exec api rails generate rspec:install`

I like my specs folder to mirror my application layout as much as possible, so I am going to place my spec files in api/spec/controllers/concerns.

To test our file processor, we could use some controlled test files.  To create them, we need to run several commands against our Docker container.  Let's look at a Docker feature to make that easier.

We have seen how to execute a single command against a running container using `docker compose exec <contianer_name> <command>`.

You can also run a container as an interactive shell using `docker-compose run <container_name> <comand>`.  The command passed to Docker **run**, launches a shell, overriding the default startup command specified in Docker Compose.

By default, our Docker Compose settings start our containers by booting our servers. We can override that default with the `bash` command to create an interactive shell where we can run commands.

Open a new terminal, and run the following command: 
`docker-compose run api bash`

That should place you in shell running within your aoi container.  Now we can execute several commands in a row without chaining each one to `docker-compose exec`.

Copy and run the following commands in your container shell.

``` bash
mkdir spec/controllers/concerns/testbook 
touch "spec/controllers/concerns/testbook/readme.md"
mkdir spec/controllers/concerns/testbook/images
touch spec/controllers/concerns/testbook/mockChapter.md
touch spec/controllers/concerns/testbook/someFile.txt
```

When you finish, type `exit` to close out your connection to this container.

Now that we have test files to work against, we can write our first spec.  **Note:** As we proceed, you can use `docker-compose exec api rspec` to run your API test suite.

``` ruby(/api/spec/controllers/concerns/book_file_finder_spec.rb)
require 'rails_helper'

RSpec.describe BookFileFinder do
  it "removes readme.md, directories, and non-md files from return" do
    path = "spec/controllers/concerns/testbook/"
    entries = BookFileFinder.new(path).entries
    expect(entries.length).to eq 1
    expect(entries[0]).to eq path+"mockChapter.md"
  end
end
```

As I often do when writing tests, I found something unanticipated.  Currently, our Class' path parameter could lack a trailing slash.  Paths ending without a slash work fine for locating the files.  The problem occurs when we build our full file paths, the lack of trailing slash creates a path like `some_file_pathFILE.md` rather than `some_file_path/FILE.md`.  Let's issue a quick update to deal with this.

``` ruby(/api/app/controllers/concerns/book_file_finder.rb)
class BookFileFinder
  attr_reader :entries
  
-   def initialize(path)
-      @path = normalize_folder(path) 
-      @entries = locate_chapter_files.sort_by! {|x| File.basename(x,".md").to_i}
-   end
  
  private
+     def normalize_folder(path)
+       path[-1] == "/" ? path : path + "/"
+     end
    
-     def locate_chapter_files
-        raw_file_list = expand_file_paths(Dir.entries(@path))
-        filter_chapter_files(raw_file_list);
-     end
    
-     def filter_chapter_files(raw_file_list)
-         raw_file_list.select do |file|
-             File.file?(file) && \
-             File.extname(file) == ".md" && \
-             !/readme\.md/i.match?(file)
-         end
-     end
    
-     def expand_file_paths(file_array)
-       file_array.map do |file|
-         @path + file
-       end
-     end
end
```

Our new `normalize_folder` method ensures that if the path does not already terminate with a slash, one gets appended.  We are also marking the methods of this class as private; our attr_reader `entries` handles all outside interactions with this class.

We should also add a test for this new path normalization function.

``` ruby(/api/spec/controllers/concerns/book_file_finder_spec.rb)
require 'rails_helper'
RSpec.describe BookFileFinder do
-   it "removes readme.md, directories, and non-md files from return" do
-     path = "spec/controllers/concerns/testbook/"
-     entries = BookFileFinder.new(path).entries
-     expect(entries.length).to eq 1
-     expect(entries[0]).to eq path+"mockChapter.md"
-   end
  
+   it "enforces proper file path" do
+     path = "spec/controllers/concerns/testbook/"
+     bad_path = "spec/controllers/concerns/testbook"
+     expect(BookFileFinder.new(path).entries).to \
+       eq BookFileFinder.new(bad_path).entries
+   end
end
```

Done!  Now let's review the `BookFileParser` class.  First add some content to your `mockChapter.md` file:

```markdown(/api/spec/controllers/concerns/testbook/mockChapter.md)
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6
Paragraph `with some stuff` that's *inline*

Some | Stuff
In   | Tables

|Another|Table|
|-------|-----|
|With   |Stuff|

* Its a list
* of things
    * And stuff

1. Write todo list
2. Check off first and second items
3. Enjoy feeling like you accomplished something
4. Procrastinate the real work
5. Panic
6. Cram
7. Repeat

> Someday they'll write this on a motivational poster
> with a picture of a sunset, and dolphins or something
```

Now we can add tests for the class.

``` ruby(/api/spec/controllers/concerns/book_file_parser_spec.rb)
require 'rails_helper'

RSpec.describe BookFileParser do
  it "creates payload of top-level blocks from array of MD files" do
    payload = BookFileParser.new(
      ["spec/controllers/concerns/testbook/mockChapter.md"]
    ).payload
    expect(payload.length).to eq 13
  end
end
```

I am limiting our test to the assumption that for each block element in our file we should return one member in our `payload` array.  Inline elements shouldn't create array members, nor should nested blocks.  Thus we expect 13 items.  It is not the most robust spec, but we don't own the majority of this code; our gem does.  Thus we focus our test on what we need as a reliable output from the class.

Take a moment to mark your methods in `BookFileParser` as private, as we did in `BookFileFinder`.  Again, we should use the `payload` attribute reader as the only public interface of this class.

## Summary

That concludes Chapter 2.  We are looking pretty rough at this point, but we have met the goal of our first iteration.  An unstoppably determined reader could sit down and slug their way through our book at this point.  

We covered a lot of ground this chapter:
1. We set up an API action `books#index` parse and pass of our book to the client.
2. Our client added its first API call.
3. We added some preliminary server-side parsing of our MD content.
4., Rspec was installed, and tests added for several classes

Now we move onto Chapter 3 and our next iteration.
