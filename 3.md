#Chapter 3: Organizing Data

As we move forward with our next iteration I'm going to be splitting this next phase of work into two chapters; the first dealing with our API changes, and then chapter 4 will look at the matching React changes. 

My first draft of this chapter had all of this grouped into a single chapter, but the result was unmanageable.  We have a lot of foundation we need to lay, and to have an iteration that enacts meaningful change we need to take a larger step forward on each side of our application than we have done in previous chapters.  

With that said, let's look at our API.

##All Content is Not Created Equal

Up to this point we've been playing fast and loose with our data structure.  Outside a few expectations we've built into methods and classes, there's not much to our data except a straight dump of content.

Now that we have the basic foundations of both our client and API established, and a communication channel proven between them, it's time to start planning.  We're reading bulk contents from our chapter files, but all that content is not created equally.  Inside those files, we have blocks of text, code, lists, and headings.  We're organized into chapters, headings, sections, and paragraphs.  And our app is completely blind to all of that.

What if we wanted to generate an index, or table of contents? If we add search, will we treat all content the same.  Or perhaps we'll want to distinguish between searches in our book's main text, and its code examples.  If a user wants to save their position and come back to it later, how do we know where they last read?  Can we create a link to specific content and send it to someone in an email, IM, or text?

These features have implications to consider for the way we organize our data.  Whether that is in database tables for our API to draw from, or our client-side data store.

## What's on (in) the table?

Let's think about the problem from the Rails side of things first.  Here we have some help from the tools we're using because we'll have an enforced structure given to us by our table normalization.  The first major decision we must make is what to put into those tables, and what to leave behind.

I'm inclined to think of a book as being made up of some basic parts: The book itself, chapters, sections, and blocks of text.  Since we're only displaying one book, having a table to store that information seems overkill.  Chapters seems like a logical division.  As do sections, and blocks. 

In our case, chapters will be made up of the individual MD files we parse.  Sections I think will be dictated by our Heading blocks (H1 - H6, or perhaps only a subset of those). And Blocks will be all the other items that fall under those sections, as well as the sections themselves, as they are elements of readable content.

Now let's consider the relationships between our elements: 
* A book has many chapters
    * A Chapter has many sections
    * A Chapter Belongs to a book
        * A section belongs to a chapter
        * A section, belongs to a larger section
        * A section has many sections
        * A section has many blocks
            * A block belongs to a section

Just looking at those relationships it's clear the most complex relationship we have in front of us is the sections.  Because headings are commonly nested one inside the other, in the taxonomy of a document, we need a way to represent that owns-many-self relationship.  In theory, we could look at each section level as its own table, but that's going to quickly lead to us duplicating code across many more models and tables.

All in all, this is a bigger bite then I'm comfortable with for one iteration.  So, let's pick our battles, and find a simpler spec.

* A Chapter has many sections
    * A block belongs to a section

We're abandoning the representation of books and sections entirely.  My first instinct was to tackle a watered-down implementation of sections in our first pass.  But even that seems like too much.  Even keeping our data taxonomy limited to chapters and blocks, we still have a long to-do list for API changes.

Here's our plan for this iteration:
* Create tables for our new models
* Define relationships
* Change the import of our book from a controller action to a runnable task
* Modify our controller action to pass a Flux Standard Action for our client to read.

That will be plenty to bite off.  We can come back to our data model in future iterations, as we need additional detail to accomplish new feautres.

## Setting up tables

Let's start by getting some tables set up.  I prefer to do this (for initial migrations), using Rail's model generators, as they'll give us both a migration for our database, and a Class in our `models/` directory we can expand upon.

Let's try not to boil the ocean, and keep our stored data simple:
```
rails generate model Chapter title:string
rails generate model Block chapter_id:integer type:string content:text
bin/rails db:migrate
```

And let's go ahead and define our relationships...

```ruby
class Chapter < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :blocks
end
```

```ruby
class Block < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :chapter
end
```

Pretty simple; now we can turn our attention to updating the way that we load content.

## Creating a task

We admitted when we set up our `book#index` action that we were committing some sins.

Our controller action has no business running a parse/read of our book content.  Setting aside the overreach of concerns, it's hugely inefficient to have that parse redone every time the action is triggered, when the content attached to the action never changes.  Now is our chance to clean that up.  We're going to set up a rake task we can run when we need to load or update our book tables.

Rails has a generator we can use:
`rails generate task rr load_book clear_book`

That generator takes the form:
`rails generate task [namespace] [action] [action]`

In our case this sets up two tasks:
`bin/rails rr:load_book`
`bin/rails rr:clear_book`

You'll notice, if you open the generated tasks, that both depend on the `:environment` task.  This dependecy will make the full environment of our Rails application available to us inside our tasks.  Now we can start moving the importer classes we set up in our last chapter into these tasks.  We'll modify them to load our database tables as we go.

```ruby
class BookFileFinder
  attr_reader :entries
  
  def initialize(path)
     @path = normalize_folder(path) 
     @entries = validate_chapters
  end
  
  private
    ...
    
    def validate_chapters
      all_entries = locate_chapter_files.sort!
      all_entries.delete_if do |file|
        load_or_invalidate_chapter(file)
      end
    end
    
    def load_or_invalidate_chapter(file)
      invalid =  true
      md_doc = CommonMarker.render_doc(File.read(file))
      md_doc.each do |node|
        if node.type == :header
          invalid = false
          Chapter.create(title: node.to_commonmark)
          break
        end
      end
      
      return invalid
    end
    
    ...
end
```

Look at our updated `BookFileFinder` class.  First, we're going to find this file a new home and move it to `lib/loader/book_file_finder.rb`, along with our 2nd file `book_file_parser.rb`.  Storing these classes in `controllers/concerns/` was always temporary.  Now that we're tying them to a rake task, they can settle into what I think will be their final destination in the `lib/` directory.

We're going to set some basic business rules up around our Chapters before we do a database import.  We're going to require that a file have at least 1 valid heading tag to be considered valid chapter. And we'll use the content of the first heading we find as the title for that chapter.

We'll pass all the files of our book through a new validate chapter method before returning entries.  That validate function will run a loop of all our files.  Using the `delete_if` enumerator, we'll remove any element from our entries Array that doesn't contain at least one heading node in the document's text.  When we find a valid chapter title, we'll create a new database record, and break from our loop of the book's nodes.

Now let's turn to our Rake task...

```ruby 
require "#{Rails.root}/lib/loader/book_file_finder"

namespace :rr do
  desc "Import content at lib/reactivating-rails/"
  task load_book: :environment do
    puts "Loading book content..."
    entries = BookFileFinder.new("#{Rails.root}/lib/reactivating-rails")
    
  end

  desc "Clear content of previously loaded iterations"
  task clear_book: :environment do
    puts "Clearing book content..."
  end
end
```

Nothing fancy, we're just calling our file finder with our book directory.  Go ahead and run the task:
`bin/rails rr:load_book`

Not much to see now, but if we open a console session (`bin/rails console`), we can pull the last chapter title imported (`Chapter.last`).  You should see something like:

`id: 9, title: "Chapter 2: Loading and Displaying Basic Content\n", created_at: "2017-08-30 01:59:40", updated_at: "2017-08-30 01:59:40"`

Not bad, but we're not getting much feedback from our rake task as it does its work.  Personally, I prefer some reporting in my console so that if something goes haywire I have a place to start digging.  I also think we're overreaching in our `BookFileFinder` class now.  The validation of a chapter is not an easy read, and that's probably a sign we're doing too much in one class.

Let's move the Chapter validation into its own parser class:

```ruby
class ChapterFile
  attr_reader :title, :body, :record
  
  def initialize(file)
    @file_path = file
    @body = CommonMarker.render_doc(File.read(file))
  end
  
  public
    def save
      unless self.invalid?
        puts "Creating chapter: #{@record.title}"
        @record.save
      end
    end
    
    def invalid?
      @body.each do |node|
        if node.type == :header
          @record = Chapter.new(title: node.to_plaintext.strip)
          return false
        end
      end
      puts "#{@file_path} removed as invalid chapter; ensure file has at least one heading."
      return true
    end
end
```

We're going to set up two public methods for this class: `save` and `invalid`.  These methods encapsulate the two main jobs we want this Class to perform for us.  First, we need a way to remove any Chapter files that don't meet our spec of having a required title/heading.  So our `invalid?` method will traverse the node map of the markdown document, setting up an unsaved model instance if a heading is found, or returning true if no suitable nodes are present.

We split the `save` logic into its own method so that we can be deliberate about when that save happens in the context of our larger Rake task.

We're also using several attribute readers so that we have an interface to several levels of our markdown chapter:
* Body, which contains the full text of the markdown
* Title, to store our assigned title.
* And record, which stores our Active Record model instance.  
 
The record attribute will be helpful when we want to start importing blocks of chapter text.  With the record in hand for each Chapter instance, we'll be able to use method chaining such as `chapter.block.create`, rather than passing IDs around when creating our blocks. 

Now we can update our Rake task to use this new class

```ruby
task load_book: :environment do
    puts "Loading book content..."
    entries = BookFileFinder.new("#{Rails.root}/lib/reactivating-rails").entries
    
    entries.delete_if do |file|
      ChapterFile.new(file).invalid?
    end
    
    entries.each do |file|
      chapter = ChapterFile.new(file)
      chapter.save
    end
  end
```

We're splitting up our work with the `ChapterFiles` class into two steps; or iterations through the collection:  
 1. Ussing delete_if, we pull out any chapter instances that are invalid.
 2. Then we pass through the remaining array again to save the remaining files.

This is not the most efficient way to do this, as we end up running our validation pass twice for the valid chapters.  But the tradeoff is that we end up with nice readable ruby in our task.  I'm willing to make that trade in a task we'll be running infrequently.

And finally, we can pull out our Chapter validation from the `BookFileFinder` class.  If you're playing along at home, you might notice we're right back where we started... refactors are like that some times.  At least when I'm driving them.

```ruby
class BookFileFinder
  attr_reader :entries
  
  def initialize(path)
     @path = normalize_folder(path) 
     @entries = locate_chapter_files.sort!
  end
  
  private
    def normalize_folder(path)
      path[-1] == "/" ? path : path + "/"
    end
    
    def locate_chapter_files
       raw_file_list = expand_file_paths(Dir.entries(@path))
       filter_chapter_files(raw_file_list);
    end
    
    def filter_chapter_files(raw_file_list)
        raw_file_list.select do |file|
            File.file?(file) && File.extname(file) == ".md" && !/readme\.md/i.match?(file)
        end
    end
    
    def expand_file_paths(file_array)
      #Array.map allows us to iterate through the array
      # Here we update each member by concatenating the directory path onto the file name
      file_array.map do |file|
        @path + file
      end
    end
end
```
Let's check in and run our rake task, `bin/rails rr:load_book`

```
Creating chapter: Chapter 0: Introduction
Creating chapter: Chapter 1: Installing React and Rails
Creating chapter: Chapter 2: Loading and Displaying Basic Content
...
```

If you check out your database in the Rails console, you should also see a Chapter record created for each chapter file.

With that behind us, the next step for us to tackle is parsing our blocks.  And seeing as we have already have instances of our Chapters being looped through while we do our `chapter.save` call, our work should be trivial.

```ruby
task load_book: :environment do
  puts "Loading book content..."
  entries = BookFileFinder.new("#{Rails.root}/lib/reactivating-rails").entries
  
  entries.delete_if do |file|
    ChapterFile.new(file).invalid?
  end
  
  entries.each do |file|
    chapter = ChapterFile.new(file)
    chapter.save
    
    chapter.body.each do |node|
      chapter.record.blocks.create(type: node.type.to_s, content: node.to_commonmark)
    end
  end
end
```

But check in and run your migration again, and you'll see that we have a problem.  It seems I've stumbled into a reserved word for Model attributes when I selected `type` as a column name.  We're going to have to change that before we move forward.  While we're running a migration anyway, it's also been bothering me that I chose the model name `Blocks`, while our `CommonMarker` gem refers to this same element as a `node`.  I think we'll have clearer code if we unify around one term, so I'm going to rename our table as well.

`bin/rails generate migration rename_table_block_as_node`

```ruby
class RenameTableBlockAsNode < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.1]
  def change
    rename_table :blocks, :nodes
    rename_column :nodes, :type, :node_type
  end
end
```

Run the migration (`bin/rails db:migrate`), and then be sure to update your Model name, file name, spec name, and association in the `Chapters` model (to `has_many :nodes`).

Finally, update your rake task:

```ruby
task load_book: :environment do
  puts "Loading book content..."
  entries = BookFileFinder.new("#{Rails.root}/lib/reactivating-rails").entries
  
  entries.delete_if do |file|
    ChapterFile.new(file).invalid?
  end
  
  entries.each do |file|
    chapter = ChapterFile.new(file)
    chapter.save
    
    chapter.body.each do |node|
      chapter.record.nodes.create(node_type: node.type.to_s, content: node.to_commonmark)
    end
  end
end
```

If you run your task again, and jump into the console you should now see populated `Node` and `Chapter` tables. We may eventually need to split the Node parsing logic off into its own class as well; but this early implementation will do for now until our needs evolve.

I'm also going to put a pin in the other rake task we generated, `rr:clear_book`.  Right now, we can skimp by using the default task Rails gives us `bin/rails db:reset`, which will clear our tables, and reset our indexes to zero.  This probably won't last; in the future as we add other models we might not want to purge the entire database every time we load an updated copy of the book. But for now, this meets our needs.  In fact, if you've run the `rr:load_book` task a few times this iteration, you might want to run `db:reset` and then `rr:load_book` before moving forward to ensure you have a clean import of data.

## Testing our importer

Before we move on let's make a few brush up changes to our test suite.

For the moment, our suite should be valid.  But we added a new business rule we should be sure we have tests to enforce.  Let's add a new document to our `testbook/` directory we set up in our last chapter.  We'll name the file `invalidChapter.md`, and put a bit of sample text inside:


```
This sample file is invalid as it contains no valid headings to be used as a chapter title.

It will test true on Chapter.invalid?
```

I'm also going to move my `book_file_finder_spec.rb` and `book_file_parse_spec.rb` files, along with their associated `testbook/` directory into a `spec/lib/` folder so that they mirror the layout of our app directory.  If we rerun the spec now, we'll get a failure on our test `BookFileFinder removes readme.md, directories, and non-md files from return`, the reason for this fail is that our file finder only concerns itself with the initial validation of the file as an MD document, and ensuring that the file is not a directory or README.md.  Go ahead and raise the expectation of this count to 2.

You'll need to make some corrections to account for your new files, and paths as well.  Go ahead and update each spec as follows:

```ruby
require 'rails_helper'
require 'loader/book_file_finder'

RSpec.describe BookFileFinder do
  it "removes readme.md, directories, and non-md files from ruturn" do
    path = "spec/lib/testbook/"
    entries = BookFileFinder.new(path).entries
    expect(entries.length).to eq 2
    expect(entries[0]).to eq path+"invalidChapter.md"
  end
  
  it "enforces proper file path" do
    path = "spec/lib/testbook/"
    bad_path = "spec/lib/testbook"
    expect(BookFileFinder.new(path).entries).to eq BookFileFinder.new(bad_path).entries
  end
end
```

```ruby
require 'rails_helper'
require 'loader/book_file_parser'

RSpec.describe BookFileParser do
  it "creates payload of top level blocks from array of MD files" do
    payload = BookFileParser.new(["spec/lib/testbook/mockChapter.md"]).payload
    expect(payload.length).to eq 13
  end
end
```

Now we're green on our tests, except the pending tests we have for our generated models.  We'll leave these stubs as a reminder for now, but I don't see a need to test the minimalist implementation we have there at the moment.

However, let's add a test suite for our chapter parser in `spec/lib/chapter_file_spec.rb`:

```ruby
require 'rails_helper'
require 'loader/chapter_file.rb'

RSpec.describe ChapterFile do
  it "invalidates chapters without titles/headings" do
    chapter_test = ChapterFile.new("spec/lib/testbook/invalidChapter.md").invalid?
    expect(chapter_test).to be_truthy
  end
  
  describe "valid chapters" do
    before(:each) do
      @chapter = chapter = ChapterFile.new("spec/lib/testbook/mockChapter.md")
    end
    
    it "have headings/titles" do
      expect(@chapter.invalid?).to be_falsey
    end
    
    it "create model instances when saved." do
      @chapter.save
      expect(Chapter.all.count).to eq(1)
    end
  end
end
```

Rerun your test suite and you should have a passing run.  We have some gaps left, particularly around our Rake task itself.  But for now, I think we can get by testing the component parts.  Now, let's update our controller action to prepare it for working with our client-side data store (Redux).

## Fluxifying your controller actions

We need to put the cart before the horse for a minute and talk about Flux.

If you're not familiar, Flux is the data pattern Redux is built upon.  In the simplest terms I can manage, Flux is a principle of unidirectional data flow.  Redux enforces this by encapsulating all state changes in instructions that get passed to our data store called Flux Standard Actions (FSAs), or usually just "actions" for short.

An action is a simple JSON object that contains a type attribute, which tells our store what needs to happen.  Actions also contain a payload of other information the store will need to accomplish the requested state change.  For example, `{type: "SOME_KEY", some_data: "stuff"}`

These actions are passed to our reducers, which are specialized functions in our store that update the state.  
1. An action gets dispatched to the store.  
2. The store checks to see if it knows how to respond to the action key specified in the `type` attribute of the action.
  * If it does, the reducer will then create a new state object for the store.
  * If it does not, the reducer returns the current unaltered state

Down the chain in React, our components are subscribed to the store, essentially listening for changes in the state.  When the state changes, the components are rendered again against this new state, and the screen is redrawn accordingly.

Our components might render interfaces that dispatch additional actions.  For example, submitting a login form might dispatch a `REQUEST_SESSION` action.  That action might get picked up by middleware (more on that later), that sends that a username and password to our API, which will then check if it's a valid sign on attempt.  If it is, it might then send back another action to our client, such as `CREATE_SESSION`, and send a payload perhaps containing a display name for the user, a token for the authentication, an expiration, and data about the user.  Then that action would make its way to our reducer, which would update the user state.  This new state might trigger our navigation bar to redraw, and we might see a login form disappear, replaced by a user welcome message.

But what we will not (should not) see is a component reaching directly into the store to modify the state.  Our componenets, our API, our web sockets, all should dispatch actions.  Our store, and more specifically our Reducer, decides how these actions influence our state, and pushes out updates as needed.

All that is to say, our controller actions should follow this pattern, and push back actions easily digested by our store.

We're close already, but there are a few things we can do to make this easier.

## Scoping our Model data

First let's create a scope in our model that we can use to limit our queries to the fields we want to be available in our store.  Rails will automatically create some columns as part of its defaults that we just don't need to have in our client store.  Fields such as `created_at`, and `updated_at` don't have much use to our store, at least in this application.

We can also use Active Record to enforce some conventions for us like ordering of elements.  It would be nice if we knew our components could pick up our store's state and have the elements ordered in a way that's ready to use.  We might still reinforce this order on the client as well in cases where it's critical.  But the active record interface is so easy... it seems a shame not to take advantage.

Let's open our node models and add a scope.

``` ruby 
# == Schema Information
#
# Table name: nodes
#
#  id         :integer          not null, primary key
#  chapter_id :integer
#  node_type  :string
#  content    :text
#  created_at :datetime         not null
#  updated_at :datetime         not null
#

class Node < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :chapter
  
  scope :fsa, -> { order(chapter_id: :asc, id: :asc ).select(:id, :chapter_id, :node_type, :content) }
end
```

We're creating a scope called `:fsa` for our model that will format our returned entries so they are prepared to place into our Actions.  First enforcing our content order: chapters first, and then the nodes within.  Then limiting the columns to only those we want in our store.

Open the console, and try it out by running `Nodes.all.fsa`.  You should get back a response like the following:

```
[#<Node id: 6, chapter_id: 1, node_type: "paragraph", content: "I'm also hoping this exercise will help me develop...">, #<Node id: 7, chapter_id: 1, node_type: "header", content: "## So, what are we building?\n">, #<Node id: 8, chapter_id: 1, node_type: "paragraph", content: "Together (In a non-linear timey-wimey sense), we a...">, #<Node id: 9, chapter_id: 1, node_type: "paragraph", content: "Why? A few reasons... First, I enjoy the easy synt...">, #<Node id: 10, chapter_id: 1, node_type: "paragraph", content: "There's also the small detail that I'm embarking o...">, ...]
```

Now let's update our controller action to use this setup in `app/api/book_controller.rb`.

``` ruby
class Api::BookController < ApplicationController
  def index
    payload = Node.all.fsa
    render json: {type: "LOAD_NODES", payload: payload}, status: 200
  end
end
```
Now we can use our `fsa` scope to prepare our active record associations for use in our Flux actions.  The scope will handle ordering for us, and set the limitation of columns we want included.  The last step in preparation is calling our render method with the JSON key.  This will help us automatically convert our payload of nodes into an array of objects (a format which as you'll see in the next chapter, is very easy for our client to digest).

I favor this approach because our scope gives us an easy centralized location where we can update the content of our Flux actions.  Right now, the benefit is less apparent, because we only have the one action that relies on this model.  But as we add actions, if we decide somewhere downstream we need to expand this element's attributes in our client-side scope (such as when we add a section ID), we'll only need to update the scope to have this change reflected in all our controller actions.  

#  Wrapping Up

We're going to stop there, and turn to our client application in our next chapter.  You'll notice we haven't addressed our Chapter's model yet, we'll be coming back to that as we move forward.  

This chapter we have:
* Migrated our book importer into a Rake Task
* Setup our first database tables and associations
* Transformed our controller action to use a Flux Standard Actions (FSA)

Now, we get to dig into Redux!
