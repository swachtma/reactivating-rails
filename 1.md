# Chapter 1: Introduction

Welcome to Reactivating Rails, my guide of using React and Rails to build modern web applications.  

While only two languages have representation in the title of this book, there is a third technology hidden under the hood.  Earlier this year I began working with Docker, and I fell in love with the simplicity of using it to run my local and production environments.  As I learned more, an idea began to percolate.

Docker makes it blissfully easy to share your entire development environment among a team of programmers.  Docker containers can be used to create perfectly replicated development environments; regardless of what local operating systems, and machine configurations each developer on a team runs.  Teams use Docker to eliminate headaches of duplicating configurations across developers, local environments, and deployments.  Put simply; a Dockerized application should behave identically, regardless of the hardware used behind it, eliminating frustrating "well, it works on my machine" bugs.

I began to wonder if Docker could be used a learning tool to similar effect.  

When working through coding books over the years, I have fought through inevitable conflicts that authors couldn't anticipate.  My version of Ruby is just a little different than your version of Ruby.  Installation instructions that work on the author's Linux virtual machine aren't nearly so easy to replicate on a Windows operating system.  A module I have installed locally behaves little differently...

Docker can prevent these seemingly inevitable small conflicts for working teams.  So, could we write books that develop example code inside Docker containers, and encapsulate the entire project inside a Git repository?  Doing so would ensure that every reader going through this book should be able to pick up our project, to work and learn on an environment identical to my own and that of other readers.

This book is in a way my proof of concept. 

My hope is this approach brings you more flexibility as a reader.  While you will need to install Docker, that should be the only time we sweat over how to install software on your local machine.  With Docker running, you'll be free to move through examples in this book as you see fit.  Every chapter in this book comes with a starter branch in our project repository.  If you find a specific chapter or topic more relevant to you than others or come to chapters worth skipping, I encourage you to do so.  Read this entire work front to back, or pick the chapters that interest you.  

Wherever you start, a single command `docker-compose up`, builds your entire local development environment, and get you started with all the appropriate example code.

It's my hope this minimizes errata, eliminate the time you would otherwise spend chasing bugs, and gives you more flexibility as a reader to pick and choose the content that helps you.

I hope you enjoy the read.

Thank you,
Scott

## So, What are we Building?

Together, we are going to build a web-reader for books, like this one, written in Markdown.  

Why?  For one, I enjoy the easy syntax and accessibility of Markdown.  Especially for a book that needs to be packed full of code examples.  Markdown gives developers a painless way to write documentation for their code.  Its use is pervasive in README files attached to projects all across the web.  Some of these README files, border on small books in and of themselves.  I think we can build a web-reader with React to make this format shine as a teaching tool.

I'm also embarking on this project alone.  I don't have an editor telling me what's right, what's wrong, or what should stay and go.  I'm bound to make mistakes, and even the things I get right might need revisiting and updating as the ecosystem changes.

So, I'm endeavoring to write this book in Markdown, and I'll be committing the book's content to a Git repository along the way.  I hope as readers use these materials some might contribute updates, revisions, or entirely new content in support of maintaining and improving this book.  My pitch for open source, version controlled editing.  

Since we are embarking on building a web-reader for just such a Markdown book in our exercises together, everything ties up nicely.  That's just the kind of meta, eat-your-own-dogfood synergy the kids are crazy about these days.

## Need to Know

Before we can begin, we need to talk about what we won't be covering in this book.  

For the sake of getting started, I'm going to assume that readers have at least some basic familiarity with React and Rails as standalone tools.  If that's not the case, I'm going to recommend that you start elsewhere and revisit this book later.

I also lean heavily on Redux in the client-side of this application for state management.  Where I need additional tools beyond React's core, you'll find me favoring tools that make Redux a first-class citizen.  I may forego the use of some tools that are the highly favored among React developers in favor of others I prefer for their tight integration with Redux.

So, if you haven't had some exposure, it might be worth a diversion to look at these tools in isolation before starting.

My personal favorites for each topic are:
1. The [Agile Development with Rails series](https://pragprog.com/book/rails5/agile-web-development-with-rails-5) is still the gold standard, in my opinion, for starting with Rails.  I've bought at least 3 major versions of this book over the years, and it continues to be a top-notch resource.
2. [Learning React: A Hands-On Guide](https://www.amazon.com/Learning-React-Hands-Maintainable-High-Performing-ebook/dp/B01N5GPFM2/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1502339479&sr=1-1-fkmr0&keywords=learning+React%3A+A+Hands-On+Guide+to+Buildi) was my entry point into React, and I think it does an especially good job of highlighting the strengths of React and introducing the **vast**  ecosystem that stems from it.
3. [The Complete Redux Book](https://leanpub.com/redux-book) is an indispensable introduction to Redux.  This book is a powerful little workhorse, just like the tool it covers.  It's compact, and I moved through it in a single night's read when I first picked it up.  However, it's been a valuable resource that I revisit frequently.
 
## A Look Ahead

At the time I was sitting down to write my first draft at chapter 1, Rails 5.1 was coming onto the scene with enhanced support for using front-end JavaScript libraries through the asset pipeline.  There are also projects like [react-rails](https://github.com/reactjs/react-rails) that can be used to integrate the two tools using Ruby Gems.

For my part, I'm going to be ignoring both.  

As you'll see soon, getting React and Rails to play nicely together is a minimal task of configuration, and I think there is a lot to be said for keeping some separation of concerns between the two tools.  Each framework is fairly opinionated, and luckily for us, there is not much overlap between their concerns.  Running a front-end application in React, and backing it up with an API built on Rails gives us a clean line of separation to look at the strengths of each tool.  This approach also lets us embrace the enhanced support in Rails 5 for API-only applications.

My point is not to say other tools or approaches aren't equally valid; only that this is the approach which I prefer.

## Conventions For this Book

Here are a few things to keep in mind as you read.  

### Command Line Tools

We use the command line extensively in this book.  I always provide full commands to copy/paste into your terminal, and unless otherwise noted, you should execute commands from your project's root.

### Docker First-Timers, Don't Worry.

I'll be explaining all the concepts you need to develop applications on Docker.  What we will **not** be covering, is Docker itself.  I have created a Docker config file on your behalf that creates the environments needed for this book.  While I explain commands necessary to work within this environment; if you want to learn more about Dockerizing applications of your own, you'll need to look elsewhere.  

If you do want to go deeper with Docker, I highly recommend [Bret Fisher's excellent course, "Docker Mastery"](https://www.udemy.com/docker-mastery) available on UDemy.

### Directing Commands With Docker

Commands you already know may look a little different.  When working with Docker, commands are often prefixed with `docker-compose exec` or `docker-compose run` to ensure they execute inside the right Docker container.  

We cover this in more detail as it becomes relevant, but for now, it might help you to think of Docker containers as a collection of tiny virtual machines running your application.  In our work together we run our application across three such containers; a Postgres database, a machine running Ruby and our Rails API, and another using NodeJS and Create-React-App.  Commands use different prefixes to communicate with each of these three runtimes.

### Dependencies are Declared in Exact Versions

 When installing dependencies (`yarn add` or `bundle add`) I always specify an exact version number.  While this is not how most developers would handle such installations, I felt it was necessary to version lock the installations we use.  

Having Docker create a perfectly replicated environment for us all to play in won't help if we all end up running distinct versions of various Gems and NPM packages.  While I settled on this as a best practice for our work together, it's not a habit you should form in your independent work.
