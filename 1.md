# Chapter 1: Installing React and Rails

## Rails new

We're going to start the installation process with the Rails side of our application.

Most are probably familiar with this process.  What you may not be aware of if you are venturing to use Rails 5 for the first time, is that we now have new generators available for bootstrapping API based applications.

The Rails side of our application is going to completely surrender the view layer to React.  So limiting the backend to an API interface alone will help us enforce this seperation.  Bootstrapping the application as an API will also leave out many of Rails componenet parts that manage the View layer, but leaving us with the Model and Controller framework we are familiar with.

If you're following along, and want to ensure matching version at the time of writting I am using:
* Ruby 2.3.1
* Rails 5.1.3

To create out application, enter the generator command:
`rails new [application name] --api` 

Or in my case:
`rails new reactive_api --api`

Then you might switch to the directory and run your bundle:
`cd reactive_api && bundle install`

While bundler finishes its work, dive into the application directory, and have a look...

## What's in an API anyway?

You'll need to be on Rails 5+ for the above *--api* flag to work correctly.  Using this flag removes a lot of overhead from our application we won't need in our API.

**Simplifies our asset pipeline, removing:**
* coffee-rails
* jquery-rails
* sass-rails 

The thought here is pretty clear.  We won't be passing anything more than JSON in our responses.  So there's no need for the JavaScript libraries CoffeeScript, or jQuery.  And similarly, the SASS processing of our CSS is now retired.  Note any of these tools might find their way into our client side application, but the need for them might be less prevalent as React generally has more powerful tools for managing state than jQuery offers.

And since React supports ES6 syntax the need for CoffeeScript is really a matter of preference.  My personal take is that the cleaned up syntax of ES6 is making the sytactic sugar supplied by CoffeeScript less and less of a draw.

And the need for SASS is less clear, as we may opt for storing our styles in the JavaScript syntax of our React components, greatly simplifying of application level CSS.

**Some other gems left behind:**
* uglifier - which handles the minification of our JavaScript assets.  We'll get minification as part of our webpack compiling when we run our React client in production.
* turbolinks - Which speeds pageloads in our rails applications by intelligently reloading on necesscary contents of our pages on route changes, simulating single page applications.  React will be inheritting this role.

You might also notice the absense of a few standard folders from our newly generated application

**Application folders MIA:**
* app/assets, vendor/assets, and lib/assets - No surpises here as we've ditched the asset pipeline.
* app/helpers - Gone with our view layey.  Keep in mind though that our *concerns* folders remain in *models/concerns* and *controllers/concerns* for similar shared logic in the Model or Controller layers.

And we've activated a few other convenience features:
* Our generators will now detect that our application is set with the flag `config.api_only = true` and will helpfully generate new application contents leaving the view layer behind accordingly.
* There is also mention of a commented out Gem rack-cors in our gemfile.  

Put simply rack-cors simplifies the authorization of cross-origin request scripts (CORS).  This is a necesscary step whenever your API application and the client opperate on different origins (domains, or sub-domains).  rack-cors helps you configure the bounds in which your API will allow cross-origin scripting, and handles the needed preflight requests accordingly.  It is a MASSIVELY helpful gem when you need to venture into the world of cross-origin requests.

For our purposes we'll be avoiding the subject of CORS entirely.  Instead we'll be using a request proxying strategy when our application runs in development modes.  Negating the need for CORS.  Then in production modes we'll be configuring Webpack to compile its production assets into the `public/` directory of our rails application.  The rails "homepage" will become the single page of our single page application, again bypassing the need for CORS requests in production.  Handy, no?

With that introduction behind us, let's turn to the client side for a moment...  

## Create React App

We're going to be using create-react-app (CRA) to bootstrap our client side application.

There are no shortage to the number of React starters out there.  You can find one pre-configured to meet most any needed combination of supporting libraries.  Unfortunately... along with the ones you want, there will probably be two or three that are more in the "nice to have" bucket, and not the "need to have".  And then probably one or two more that are in the "what the hell do this thing do" bucket.

Starters are fine as you gain experience, you'll find one that fits your style, and learn to tweak it the last 10% it needs to be a perfect fit.

But when you're starting out, it's strongly recommended that you start with create-react-app, a minimalist configuration that is entirely geared toward getting you started quickly with *React*.  It leaves the extensibility to you, and going through those steps a few time wil help you immensly when you decide to move on.  You can ignore this advice if you choose.  Just know that some members of the React community may make stern "tsk tsk" noises if you ever confess this mortal sin to them. 

you can install create-react-app with NPM.  But you'll need to set the global flag:
`npm install -g create-react-app`

Then you can create a new application:
`create-react-app [name]`

In my case, I'm going to use the imaginative name, reactive-client:
`create-react-app reactive-client`

*(Note: I'd recommend executing this command outside of your Rails application folder hierarchy.  There's no need for the folders to be nested, and personally I enjoy the clean seperation of client side, and API application files.)*

When your command is finished executing you'll have a new directory for your client-side project files.  If you open that up you'll see a folder for `node_modules`, that not surprisingly contains your node modules.  

There's also a `public` folder, which we are not going to use, or more fair to say we won't be using in it's current home.  This folder is used when running our application in production using compiled assets.  When we reach this stage in our journey, we'll be targetting this folder to build inside our Rails application, replacing the index files there with our React client.  For now, we can politely ignore these files.

The bulk of our work will happen in the `src` directory.  If you open it, you should notice immediatly how much less opinionated CRA is compared to React.  At the time of writting I have the following:

    App.css                     #Stylesheet for our starter App Component
    App.js                      #A starter componenet for our app
    App.test.js                 #Test suite smoke test
    index.css                   #Application level css
    index.js                    #Javascript entrypoint for our application
    logo.svg                    #A stylish blue logo with swirlie bits
    registerServiceWorker.js    #I have no fucking clue but let's learn!

There's not a lot of opinions to be had among these 7 files.  Comparing it to rails rather firm thoughts on project structure can be uncomforatble I've found for some Rails developers picking up react.  Resist the urge to panic for now.  As we add complexity to our app, we'll set conventions for file structures, and the concerns those files will manage.

## Boot the server(s)

Now that we're installed, it's time to boot up our servers and make a quick health check.

Since we're already poking around in our client folders, let's start there.

Within your client folder, execute the command:
`npm start`

Your console should helpfully report that your app can now be viewed on localhost:8080.  So let's go check that out!
