# Chapter 1: Introduction

Welcome to Reactivating Rails, my guide of using React and Rails to build modern web applications.  While only these two languages are reflected in the title of this book, there is a third hidden under the hood.  Earlier this year I began working to contianerize my applications, and I fell in love with the simplicity of using Docker to run my local and production environments.  As I learned more, an idea began to percolate.

Docker makes it blissfully easy to share your entire development environement among a team of programmers.  Docker containers can be used to create a perfectly replicated develop environment; regardless of what local opperating systems, and machine configurations each developer runs.  Teams are using this power to simplify the headaches of duplicating runtimes accross developers, local environments, and deployments.  Put simply, a Dockerized application should run exactly the same, regardless of the hardware it's placed upon.

I began to wonder if Docker could be used a learning tool for similar effect.  

When working through coding books over the years I have fought through inevitabvle conflicts that authors couldn't anticipate.  My version of Ruby might be a little different.  A package I have installed locally might behave differently than a module used by thr author.  Or code might behave just a little bit differntly on a Windows machine than on the Author's OSX latop.

But I wodner if Docker can prevent these seemingly inevitable small conflicts.  Could we write books that developed example code i side Docker containers, and encapsulate the entire project inside a Git repository?  Doing do would ensure that every reader going through this book should be able to pick up our prject repository, to work and learn on an environment identical to my own, and to other readers.

This book, is in a way my proof of concept. 

My hope is this will bring you more flexibility as a reader.  While you will need to install Docker, that should be the only time we sweat over how to install software on your local machine.  With Docker running, you'll be free to move through examples in this book as you see fit.  Every chapter in this book comes with a starter branch in our project respoitory.  If you find certain chapter or topics more relevant to you than others, or come to chapters worth skipping I encourage you to do so.  Read this entire work front to back, or pick the chapters that interest you.  Whenever you start, with a single command `docker-compose up`, you'll be able to build a local development environment, clone out the appropriate branch for the chapter, and start following along with examples.

Its my hope this wil minimize errata, eliminate time you spend chasing bugs I couldn't predict, and give you more flexibility as a reader to pick and choose the content that helps you.

I hope you enjoy the read.

Thanks you,
Scott

## So, what are we building?

Together (In a non-linear timey-wimey sense), we are going to build a web-reader for books, like this one, written in Markdown language.  

Why?  A few reasons...  First, I enjoy the easy syntax and accessibility of Markdown.  Particularly for a book that needs to be packed full of code examples.  Markdown gives developers a painless way to write documentation for their code, and it's widely used in README.md files attached to projects across the web.  Some of these README files, border on small books in and of themselves.  And I think we can build a web-reader in React that will make this format shine as a teaching tool.

I'm also embarking on this project alone.  I don't have an editor who will tell me what's good, what's bad, or what should stay and go.  I'm bound to make mistakes, and even the things I get right will need to be revisited and updated as the ecosystem changes.

So, I'm embarking to write this book in Markdown and I'll be committing the book's contents to its own git repository along the way.  My hope is that as readers use these materials some might contribute updates, revisions, or entirely new content in support of maintaining and improving this book.  This is my pitch for open source, version controlled editing.  

And since we'll be embarking to build a web-reader for just such Markdown books as we move through this exercise together, everything ties up nicely.  That's just the kind of meta, eat-your-own-dogfood synergy the kids are crazy about these days.

## What you need to know

Before we can begin, we need to talk about what we won't be covering in this book.  For the sake of getting started, I'm going to assume that readers will have at least some basic familiarity with React and Rails both as standalone tools.  If that's not the case, I'm going to recommend that you start elsewhere and revisit this book later.

I'll also be leaning heavily on Redux in the client-side of this application for client-side state management.  Where I need additional tools beyond React/Redux, you'll find me favoring tools that keep Redux at the forefront.  I may forego the use of some tools that are the highly favored among React developers in favor of others I prefer for their tight integration with Redux.

So, if you've not had some basic exposure, it might be worth a diversion to look at these tools in isolation before diving in.

My personal favorites for each topic are:
1. The [Agile Development with Rails series](https://pragprog.com/book/rails5/agile-web-development-with-rails-5) is still the gold standard, in my opinion, for starting with Rails.  I've bought at least 3 major versions of this book over the years, and it continues to be a top-notch resource.
2. [Learning React: A Hands-On Guide to Building Maintainable, High-Performing Web Application User Interfaces Using the React JavaScript Library](https://www.amazon.com/Learning-React-Hands-Maintainable-High-Performing-ebook/dp/B01N5GPFM2/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1502339479&sr=1-1-fkmr0&keywords=learning+React%3A+A+Hands-On+Guide+to+Buildi) was my entry point into React, and I think it does as especially good job of highlighting the strengths of React, and giving introduction to the **very** large ecosystem that stems from it, without overwhelming beginners.
3. And finally, [The Complete Redux Book](https://leanpub.com/redux-book) is a great introduction to Redux.  This book is a powerful little workhorse, just like the tool it covers.  It's compact, and I moved through it in a single night's read when I first picked it up.  But it's been a valuable resource that I revisit frequently in the time since.
 
## And a look ahead...

At the time I'm sitting down to free write this first pass at chapter 1, Rails 5.1 is just coming onto the scene with enhanced support for using front-end JavaScript libraries through the asset pipeline.

There are also major projects like `react-rails` that can be used to integrate the two tools.

For my part, I'm going to be ignoring both.  As you'll see soon, getting React and Rails to play nicely together is a minimal task of configuration, and I think there is a lot to be said for keeping some separation of concerns between the two.  Each framework is fairly opinionated about the way things should be done.  And luckily for us, there is not much overlap in those concerns.  Running a front-end application in React, and backing it up with an API built on Rails gives us a clean line of separation.

This also lets us embrace enhanced support in Rails 5 for API only applications.  And that API backend lends itself nicely to the Flux (FSA) architecture that drives Redux, and by extension React.

My point is not to say other tools or approaches aren't equally valid.  But this is the approach I prefer.

## Conventions For this Book

A few things to keep in mind as you read.  

* We will use the command line extensively in this book.  I always provide full commands you can copy/paste into your terminal, and unless otherwise noted, you should assume commands should be run from your project root.
* If this is your first time working with Docker, don't worry.  I'll be explaining concepts you needs to know to develop on Docker.
* What we will **not** be covering in-depth is Docker itself.  I have created a Docker config file on your behalf that creates the environment you need for this book.  While I do cover how to work within this environment, if you want to learn more about creating your own Dockerized applciations you'll need to look elsewhere.  (I personally recommend [Brett Fisher's excellent course, avail on UDemy]())
* Command you are familiar with may look a little different working with Docker.  Commands will be prefixed with `docker-compose exec <contianer name>` or `docker-compose run <contianer name>` to ensure they execute inside the right container runtime.  We'll cover this in more detail as it become relevant.
* Commands used to install dependencies (`yarn add` or `bundle add`) will always specify an exact version number to be installed.  While this is not how most developers would handle such installations, I felt it was necessary to version lock the packages we use.  Havind Docker create a perfectly replicated environment for us all to play in won't help if we all end up running distinct versions of various Gems and NPM packages.
