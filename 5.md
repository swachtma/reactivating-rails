# Chapter 5: The Client Store

Now that our API is piping back JSON, we are ready to update our client.  In this chapter, we configure Redux for client-side storage of our application's state.

## Getting Started 

If you're starting here or jumping between chapters, I recommend executing the code below to clone the project and check out the branch for this chapter.

``` bash
# Copy and paste the following commands to check out the starter commit
git clone https://github.com/swachtma/reactivating-rails-app.git && \
cd reactivating-rails-app && \
git checkout ch5-starter
```

## Installing Redux

We need to do a little setup before we can dive into our work.

We are going to install Redux, as well as `react-redux`, its official toolkit for working with React.  You can do this through docker-compose, similar to using bundler when installing Ruby gems in previous chapters.

Run the following commands in your project root, and wait for the installations to finish:

``` bash
docker-compose exec client yarn add redux@4.0.0
docker-compose exec client yarn add react-redux@5.0.7
```

To start, we must set up our store and connect it to our React components.  Create a new directory `src/reducers` inside your client folder.  Inside, create a file `store.js`.  This file is to be the root of our Redux installation.

We're going to start small.

``` javascript(/client/src/reducers/store.js)
import { createStore } from "redux";

const store = createStore((state,action) => state);

export default store;
```

Using a method provided by Redux, `createStore`, we instantiate a new store.  Inside, we're providing a function as a parameter: `createStore((state,action) => state);`.  

For the moment, this function is serving as our reducer.  A reducer, if you are not familiar, is a function that at its simplest receives two arguments; the current state of our store, and an action.  Reducers always return either a **new** state object or the current state object, without alterations.  

This simple function meets the criteria of a Reducer, although it only ever returns the unaltered state.  When we write full-fledged reducers, they exist to build an updated application state in response to actions dispatched to our store. 

Let's revisit that concept in a moment, after connecting our store to our React components.

Open `src/index.js` and modify it as follows:

``` javascript(/client/src/index.js)
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
+ import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
+ import store from './reducers/store';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';
import registerServiceWorker from './registerServiceWorker';

+ window.store = store;

ReactDOM.render(
+   <Provider store={store}>
+       <App />
+   </Provider>
  ,document.getElementById('root')
);
    
registerServiceWorker();
```

We are wrapping the `App` component inside a component `Provider`, given to us by react-redux.  Provider makes our `store` available to all of its descendant components.  Not just to the `<App />` component it wraps directly, but any children it renders, or grandchildren further down our component tree.  By wrapping it around our root component, we gain access to our store throughout our entire application.

Notice I have also assigned our store to the browser's `window` object.  This assignment allows us to query our store in our browser's console, allowing us to smoke test its behavior.

## The Store and Reducers

Above, we said a reducer is a function which takes a state and an action and returns a new or unaltered state.  

Remember, an action is simply an object with a defined shape; `{type: "SOME_KEY", payload: { some_data: "stuff"}}`.  The type parameter is a unique name for the action inside of our application.  An action's type tells a reducer whether or not it needs to recalculate our application state in response to a dispatched action.  The `payload` of the action should contain all the information needed to do so.

When sending an action to our store (called dispatching), such as: `store.dispatch({type: "SOME_KEY", payload: { some_data: "stuff"}}` the action is passed to our reducer functions. Each reducer checks the value of `type`, and will respond as needed.

It is possible to meet all of an application's needs with a single reducer function.  It's more common though to nest reducers so that several functions share ownership of the application's state.  In our case, that might mean a dedicated reducer function to manage the `nodes` key of our store, and another managing a `chapters` key.

When dispatching an action, it is visible to **ALL** of our reducers, and its `type` attribute dictates which reducer(s) respond, and how.  The action should also contain everything in its payload that the reducers need to accomplish their work. Our reducers read the current state from our store and use the action's payload to returns a **new** state for our application.  If the action's `type` is unknown to a particular reducer, then that reducer returns the current unaltered state.

Before we build our first real reducer function, let's spend a moment thinking about how to structure our application state.

## Client-Side Data Structure 

In Redux, a client-side data store is nothing more than a JavaScript object representing our state.

As with our database tables, we need to plan our client-side data structure to support our business rules.  The structure of our store can impact the way we populate, mutate, and access our state.  There are two design approaches we commonly see: deep structures and broad structures.

Deep structures use nesting of elements to represent their relations.  An example for our purposes might look like the following:

``` javascript
{
  content: [ 
      { chapter_id, title, 
        nodes: [
          { node_id, content},{...}
        ]
      }
      { chapter_id, title,
        nodes: [{...},{...}]
      }
  ]
}
```

Above we have all our chapters grouped into an array of objects.  Nested within each chapter, is an array of its nodes.  The advantage of this approach is with speed of access; if we want to pull all the nodes for a single chapter, we can do so quickly by searching out the chapter and traversing to its nodes.

In trade, you add complexity when loading or updating data.  If we wanted to load nodes to our store for several chapters at once, we'd need to push updates down several branching paths on our state tree.   Further complicating things, Redux needs us to return a **new** instance of the state, not an update to the old object.  

For these reasons, I tend to favor the use of broad and flat Redux stores like the following:

``` javascript
{
  chapters: [{id, title}, {...}]  
  nodes: [{id, chapter_id, content},{...}]
}
```

With this structure, when loading nodes, we can ignore the `chapters` section of our store entirely.  

Inside each area of our store, our ActiveRecord ID's can be used to enforce the proper content order.   We are also going to ensure our store **enforces** this rule client-side.  When populating the store, we can ensure chapters and nodes sort sequentially on these IDs.  Lower level elements like nodes can enforce a multi-level sort, first by their chapter_id, and then the node's id.  

With those decisions made, let's move forward.

## Building Our First Reducer

Our first reducer must prepare our store to load book nodes returned from our API.  Our reducer should listen for actions with a type `LOAD_NODES` as the signal for this work.

``` javascript(/client/src/reducers/store.js)
import { createStore } from "redux";

+ let default_state = {nodes: []};

const store = createStore(
+   function(state = default_state,action){
+     switch (action.type) {
+       case("LOAD_NODES"):
+         return Object.assign({},state,
+         { nodes: action.payload}
+         );
+       default:
+         return state;
+     }
+   }
);

export default store;
```

Our reducer uses a switch statement to listen for actions with the type `LOAD_NODES`.  Using `Object.assign` it then builds a new state object.  The `Object.assign` method merges several object's keys into the object passed as its first argument.  We pass an object literal as the first parameter to ensure we end this process with a new object instance, and not update to an existing object.

This pattern of returning of a **new** object is critical to Redux's ability to detect state mutations.  Redux listens for reference changes in our state object.  Rather than doing deep evaluations of equality, if our state's object reference remains unchanged, Redux assumes our state is likewise unchanged.  This assumption is part of what makes Redux so fast.  It also leaves the burden on you to accurately produce a new object, and by extension, a new reference, when the state **does** mutate.

Our reducer's function definition also changed to assign a default value for the state parameter of our store.

Open your Browser, and load your application at `localhost`.  Let's run some commands in the console.

``` javascript
# Run commands one line at a time so you can monitor what's happening in your store.
store.getState();
store.dispatch({type: "LOAD_NODES", payload: [{id: 1, chapter_id: 1, content: "# Some Heading"}]})
store.getState();
store.dispatch({type: "SOME_ACTION", payload: "Some stuff"})
store.getState();
```

This example is why I like to make the store available on the browser's window object.  When we add new actions, we can quickly validate our reducers by doing some test dispatches against our store.

On the first call to `store.getState()` we see our default state returned, including an empty array of nodes.  Then our first dispatched action loads an example node.  After dispatching a final action, the state returns unaltered since our reducer doesn't respond to the `SOME_ACTION` type.  

That is reducers in a nutshell; we operate on what we understand and own and ignore everything else.

## Combine Reducers 

Things would get unwieldy fast if we needed to manage our entire state from a single reducer in an application of any significant size.  For that reason, redux provides `combineReducers()` to divide our state among specialized sub-reducers.

Below we split off the `nodes` key of our state into an isolated reducer.  Create a new file `reducers/nodes.js`.

``` javascript(/client/src/reducers/nodes.js)
let default_state = [];

const nodesReducer = function(state = default_state,action){
  switch (action.type) {
    case("LOAD_NODES"):
      return [...action.payload];
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

export default nodesReducer;
```

This example is an almost straight migration of the reducer we wrote a moments ago.   Our updated default state variable is now an array literal, rather than our previous value `{nodes: []}`.  This change gives a clue to what is happening.  Rather than managing the entire state tree, we are configuring this reducer to own just one concern, the array of nodes in our book.

As a result, our reducer's response to `LOAD_NODES` has changed.  We no longer return an object, but rather an array of our nodes.  One thing hasn't changed; we still return new instances of our state rather than updating.  We do this using the array literal syntax and a spread operator to set up a new array with all the nodes from our action payload; `return [...action.payload]`.  

As before, if our reducer doesn't know to handle an action type, it returns an unaltered copy of the state, in this case,  our existing array of nodes.

Now let's update our `store.js` file to use this new reducer.

``` javascript(/client/src/reducers/store.js)
+ import { createStore, combineReducers } from "redux";
+ import nodes from './nodes';

const store = createStore(
+   combineReducers({nodes})
);

export default store;
```

First, we import our new `nodesReducer()` function as a module under the name `nodes`.  Then, updating `createStore` to use `combineReducers`, we pass in an object whose keys include our imported reducer.

Let's revisit the browser console and look at our default state.

``` javascript
JSON.stringify(store.getState())
# => {"nodes":[]}
```

Our default state is right back where it started.  The difference now is that our nodes reducer can painlessly operate on the `nodes` key of our store.  The sub-reducer needs no awareness of our store's structure outside this one key it owns.

Where did the `nodes` key name originate?  That's a small gift of ES2015's object destructing.  When we passed an object to `combineReducers`, we didn't specify any key names.  The parser therefore assumes that the name of our variable, `nodes`, matches the name we want to assign as the attribute key.  We could have passed `combineReducers({nodes: nodes})` to the same result.

## Domain Specific Reducer Logic

Earlier this chapter, we decided to enforce content order in our reducers.  We can expand `nodesReducer` to perform this sorting when adding nodes to our state.

``` javascript(/client/src/reducers/nodes.js)
let default_state = [];

+ export const sortNodes = (nodes) => {
+   return nodes.sort((a,b) =>{
+     if(a.chapter_id === b.chapter_id){
+       return a.id - b.id;
+     } else {
+       return a.chapter_id - b.chapter_id;
+     }
+   });
+ };

const nodesReducer = function(state = default_state,action){
  switch (action.type) {
    case("LOAD_NODES"):
+       return [...sortNodes(action.payload)];
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

export default nodesReducer;
```

We've defined a new function `sortNodes`, which first enforces a sort order on the node's chapter_id value, and then performs a secondary sort on the node ID.  As seen before, we use the spread operator to ensure the return value is producing a new array.

This pattern is one of my favorite aspects of sub-reducers; defining clear operating areas to store code and manage business rules for specific areas of our state.

## Structuring our Client Project

Now that we have our store and a reducer in place, we should set up some other convenience tools for our store.

### Constants Over Strings

Create a new folder `src/constants/` and file `src/constants/nodes.js`.  Inside it place the following:

``` javascript(/client/src/constants/nodes.js)
export const LOAD_NODES = "LOAD_NODES";
```

A constants file gives us a defined list of `type` values for our store.  An action can accept **any** value in its type attribute.  Our store happily returns the current state anytime it doesn't recognize a dispatched action's type.  Thus our store "fails" silently if we pass it "LOAD_NODE" when we meant "LOAD_NODES".  Writing a constants file gives us a defined set of keys from which to draw.  If you’re using an IDE that auto-completes variable names, all the better.

Let's update our reducer to use this constants file.

``` javascript(/client/src/constants/nodes.js)
+ import * as constants from '../constants/nodes';

let default_state = [];

- export const sortNodes = (nodes) => {
-   return nodes.sort((a,b) =>{
-     if(a.chapter_id === b.chapter_id){
-       return a.id - b.id;
-     } else {
-       return a.chapter_id - b.chapter_id;
-     }
-   });
- };

const nodesReducer = function(state = default_state,action){
  switch (action.type) {
+     case(constants.LOAD_NODES):
      return [...sortNodes(action.payload)];
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

export default nodesReducer;
```

You might not be familiar with this ES2015 module syntax yet, but it is going to be a big help to us.  The `import * as ...` syntax imports all the exportables from the referenced file under a namespace.  In our example above, all our constants come back under the namespace `constants` and are accessible as chained properties.  

This namespacing lets us write nice readable code in our case statements `case(constants.LOAD_NODES)`.

### Action Creators

Since we use our actions a lot, it helps to have functions that construct these objects for us consistently.  Over time, we might also need to refactor our actions.  If we produce actions from centralized functions, we can update the action creator as needed, rather than chase down every use of that action scattered throughout our application.

Create a folder `src/actions/` and file  `src/actions/nodes.js`, with the following content.

``` javascript(/client/src/actions/nodes.js)
import * as constants from '../constants/nodes';

export const loadNodes = (payload) => ({type: constants.LOAD_NODES, payload});
```

Our new function `loadNodes` takes a payload of information and returns an action.  We are using an ES2015 shortcut in our function definition to return an object literal by wrapping the function body in parentheses `({})`. 

We are further simplifying the syntax by using the key naming shorthand we introduced earlier this chapter.  Without a key name for the `payload` variable we assign into the object, the attribute uses our variable name, in this case `payload`.

The more verbose version of this function would be:

``` javascript
export const loadNodes = (payload) => {
  return {type: constants.LOAD_NODES, payload: payload}
}
```

Either way, the resulting action has the form expected by our reducer.

## Bringing it All Together

We can now update our `App` component to use our store rather than maintaining an internal state.

We are going to do that with the help of `react-redux` and its `connect` method.  `connect` subscribes our components to our Redux state, and allows us to dispatch actions from within them.  The connect function though, has a somewhat unusual syntax:

``` javascript
connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Component)
```

Notice the double parentheses on this function invocation?  This double invocation is needed because the function `connect` itself returns a function, which is then immediately invoked with a component as its argument.  That returned function then constructs, as **its** return value, a new component whose properties are a merge of your store state, and that component's props.  

Let's take a look by modifying our App Component.

``` javascript(/client/src/App.js)
import React, { Component } from 'react';
+ import { connect } from 'react-redux';
+ import { loadNodes } from './actions/nodes';
import axios from 'axios';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';

+ const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
+   book_body: state.nodes
+ });

+ const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => ({
+   dispatchLoadNodes: (payload) => dispatch(loadNodes(payload))
+ });

class App extends Component {
  componentWillMount(){
    axios.get("/api/nodes")
    .then(
      (response) => {
+         this.props.dispatchLoadNodes(response.data);
      }
    )
    .catch(
      (error) => {
        console.log(error);
      }
    );
  }
  
  renderContentBlocks = (content) => {
    let content_blocks = [];
    content.forEach((block) => {
      content_blocks.push(<p key={content_blocks.length}>{block.content}</p>)
    });
    return content_blocks;
  }
  
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <div className="App-header">
          <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
          <h2>Reactivating Rails: A work in progress</h2>
        </div>
        <div className="App-intro">
          { this.renderContentBlocks(this.props.book_body) }
        </div>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

+ export default connect(
+   mapStateToProps,
+   mapDispatchToProps
+ )(App);
```

We begin by defining two functions `mapStateToProps` and `mapDispatchToProps`.  As their names imply, these functions map elements of our store to the wrapped component's properties.

`mapStateToProps` receives a reference to our store, enabling us to select elements from our state (in this case `nodes`), and map them to the properties of our components.

Similarly, `mapDispatchToProps` is passed a reference to the `store.dispatch` method.  This connection gives our components an easy way to dispatch actions and modify our application state.

Our App component now uses our `loadNodes` action creator to populate our store when our API request completes.  This dispatched action replaces the use of the component's `setState` method.

I tend to name my dispatch functions `dispatchActionCreator` to make it clear they trigger dispatches to the store.  We've defined `dispatchLoadNodes` as a function, requiring a single argument (our nodes array).  When invoked, our action creator produces an action and dispatches it to our store.

Notice that references to `this.state` changed to `this.props` in our component.  `connect` passes values to our components as **props**.   Components can still maintain an internal state separate from Redux using `this.state` and the `setState` functions.  This type of dual state is commonly used to divide component level states (is this button active), from the global state (is this user authenticated).  Anything fed into our components from Redux arrives in our components as props, helping us distinguish between the two.

Finally, we call `connect` and pass it our two mapping functions, and the App component itself.  This expression becomes the new default exportable for our file.

This first component is an admittedly shallow look at what connect does.  When you are comfortable with its primary uses, I strongly recommend a more in-depth investigation.  The creator of Redux, Dan Abramov appeared in a podcast with [Read The Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJ38wSFbM3A), to review the internals of react-redux's `Provider` and `connect`.  I highly recommend giving it an hour of your time.

## Wrapping Up with Some Tests

Before we close out this chapter, our action creators and reducers would benefit from some test coverage.

Before we begin adding new specs, we should check our status.  When working with Rails, we used `docker-compose exec` to run specs each time we wanted to retest.  Create React App though can run tests in a watcher mode, rerunning tests each time file changes are detected.  To make this feature work with Docker, we need a persistent terminal session into our client container; we can do this with `docker-compose run`.

Open a new terminal and execute the following command.

``` bash
docker-compose run client npm test
```

You'll need to give the container a few moments to start, once it has, your terminal watches for file changes and executes tests as needed.  You'll see that we have some repairs to make in our App component tests.

### Providing Tests a Store

Let's look at `src/app.test.js` which is failing since we wrapped our App component in `connect()`.

```
Invariant Violation: Could not find "store" in either the context or props of "Connect(App)". Either wrap the root component in a <Provider>, or explicitly pass "store" as a prop to "Connect(App)".
```

Luckily, the error message is pretty explicit.  The `connect` method expects a `store` to be available, either from a wrapping `Provider` element or set as a property on the component.  Passing store directly as a prop would require us to also pass that property to any child components we later render from App.  So I opt to let Provider do our heavy lifting.

``` javascript(/client/src/App.spec.js)
import React from 'react';
+ import {Provider} from 'react-redux';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import store from './reducers/store';
import App from './App';

it('renders without crashing', () => {
  const div = document.createElement('div');
+   ReactDOM.render(<Provider store={store}><App /></Provider>, div);
});
```

There are still some console errors in my test suite where we haven't correctly mocked out our API calls.  However we'll be completely removing API calls from our components soon, so I am unconcerned with these messages for now.

### Organizing Client Test Files

I prefer to keep my client-side tests in the same directory as the code under test.  It rankles a bit not to consolidate client-side tests into a `spec/` folder, mirroring our API.  Jest, unlike Rails though, needs to explicitly import the modules of our application we want to test.  Having the spec files and code in the same directory makes module paths much shorter, and resistant to typos.

### Testing Action Creators

Let's test our action creators, and introduce a new concept; snapshot testing.  Create a file `src/actions/nodes.spec.js`.

``` javascript(/client/src/actions/nodes.spec.js)
/* global expect */
import * as actions from './nodes';

describe("Nodes actionCreators", ()=>{
  test("loadNodes(node)", ()=>{
    expect(actions.loadNodes([{contents: "Test node"}])).toMatchSnapshot();
  });
});
```

Since our action creators are trivial object factories, I prefer to test them with snapshots.  Jest provides us with a method `toMatchSnapshot()` which, on our first test execution, creates a new directory next to our test file `__snapshots__`, and inside a file named `nodes.spec.js.snap`.  

This snapshot file contains an object map representing the output of our first test run.  On later test executions, our expectation checks that our spec result matches this snapshot, and fails if they are not a perfect match.

This feature is particularly helpful when testing objects since snapshots test for deep equality.  There's a balance here though; snapshot tests are dead simple to write.  The expectations tested though are also rather dumb; either the test value exactly matches our snapshot, or it doesn't.  

For example, look what happens if I add an exclamation point to our spec's content.

``` bash
expect(value).toMatchSnapshot()
    
    Received value does not match stored snapshot 1.
    
    - Snapshot
    + Received
    
     Object {
       "payload": Array [
         Object {
    -      "contents": "Test node",
    +      "contents": "Test node!",
         },
       ],
       "type": "LOAD_NODES",
     }
```

A one character change fails our test. It's up to you to review the diff produced by the failed test and determine if the was change a critical failure, or if the snapshot should be updated.

## Testing your Reducers

Let's test our reducer next.  Create a new file `src/reducers/nodes.spec.js`.  

``` javascript(/client/src/reducers/nodes.spec.js)
/* global expect */
import  nodesReducer, { sortNodes } from './nodes';
import * as actions from '../actions/nodes';

let defaultState = [];
let newState = [{contents: "Test node"}];

describe("nodes Reducer", ()=>{
  test("LOAD_NODES overwrites nodes array",()=>{
    expect(
      nodesReducer(defaultState,actions.loadNodes(newState))
    ).toEqual(newState);
  });
});
```

Since reducers are merely pure functions, testing is uncomplicated.  We can test their outcomes in isolation by passing in a starting state value and an action and asserting against the output.  To test our "LOAD_NODES" action, we define default and expected states for our test.  Then, using our action creator, we "dispatch" the action by passing it directly to the reducer function.

We should also test our sort function.  Let's set up some sample data for our test, and use a snapshot again to check our expectations.

``` javascript(/client/src/reducers/nodes.spec.js)
/* global expect */
import  nodesReducer, { sortNodes } from './nodes';
import * as actions from '../actions/nodes';

let defaultState = [];
let newState = [{contents: "Test node"}];
+ let sampleNodes = [
+   {id: 4, chapter_id: 2, node_type: "paragraph", content: "Fourth"},
+   {id: 3, chapter_id: 2, node_type: "paragraph", content: "Third"},
+   {id: 7, chapter_id: 1, node_type: "paragraph", content: "Second"},
+   {id: 6, chapter_id: 1, node_type: "paragraph", content: "First"}
+ ];

describe("nodes Reducer", ()=>{
+   test("nodesSort orders by chapter id and then node id", ()=>{
+     expect(sortNodes(sampleNodes)).toMatchSnapshot();
+   });
  
-   test("LOAD_NODES overwrites nodes array",()=>{
-     expect(
-       nodesReducer(defaultState,actions.loadNodes(newState))
-     ).toEqual(newState);
-   });
});
```

This use-case is where snapshot tests excel.  We have many expectations about sort order boiled into a single test.  We can review the snapshot once, then forget about it and move on, trusting our snapshot to alert us if something changes.

``` javascipt
// Jest Snapshot v1, https://goo.gl/fbAQLP

exports[`nodes Reducer nodesSort orders by chapter id and then node id 1`] = `
Array [
  Object {
    "chapter_id": 1,
    "content": "First",
    "id": 6,
    "node_type": "paragraph",
  },
  Object {
    "chapter_id": 1,
    "content": "Second",
    "id": 7,
    "node_type": "paragraph",
  },
  Object {
    "chapter_id": 2,
    "content": "Third",
    "id": 3,
    "node_type": "paragraph",
  },
  Object {
    "chapter_id": 2,
    "content": "Fourth",
    "id": 4,
    "node_type": "paragraph",
  },
]
`;
```

## Finishing Up

Our configuration of Redux is complete, and we are ready to handle more complex states in our client.  In chapters 4 and 5 we set a lot of foundation; it might occur to you we have now spent two chapters to end back where we started.  

The good news is, most of this prep work is behind us, and we are ready to make significant changes to our application.  It is worth noting though the cost of configuring Redux.  In complex applications, the benefits of Redux come from having a centralized point to manage your application state.  Just be sure you have enough state to justify the cost of setup.
